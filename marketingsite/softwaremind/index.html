<h1>SoftwareMind<a class="headerlink" href="#softwaremind" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A dev manual for software literate organisations</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have twenty years experience &#8220;in the trenches&#8221; of software
development - writing commercial and open source software for cutting
edge ISPs, major financial houses and not-for-profit organisations, in
big offices, tiny offices or on globally distributed teams.</p>
<p>And I have learnt a lot about what works, and what does not, when it
comes to getting software out of the door.</p>
<p>This book is my attempt to distill those two decades of lessons, into
one book.  Well, maybe two books.  And a website. OK, so there is a
lot to distill ...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-this-book-is-organised">
<h2>How this book is organised<a class="headerlink" href="#how-this-book-is-organised" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Mostly what needs to be distilled is not <em>how</em> to create software and
software teams, a lot of this book is about ... why.  Why is software
eating the world, why do certain practises work well and why do
certain pathologies still run in our organisations.</p>
<p>I call this <em>why</em>, The Software Mind.  The <em>how</em> is The Dev Manual.</p>
<p>So there are two kinds of chapter - one trying to explain the why, the
context for the more detailed, how-to chapters. Both are useful to
read, and you can think of this as two interleaved books.</p>
<p>So, lets start with probably the most important idea - that of
Software Literacy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software-literacy">
<h1>Software Literacy<a class="headerlink" href="#software-literacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I&#8217;m standing in a cavernous room underneath a bustling, noisy pub in
London&#8217;s Covent Garden.  It was a fine Summers day and the evening is
sharply cooking.</p>
<p>I look around at the 90-odd developers, graduates and entrepreneurs in
the room, and, as I have been persuaded to sponsor this meeting, now
all I have to do is give a quick speech.</p>
<p>I never quite know what to do for these sort of speeches - so I decide
to give a history lesson. Yes. A history lesson. Gripping stuff, some
were even rolling their eyes in excitement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good one though. You see, in 1454, Johannes Gutenberg printed
the first of his Bibles using movable type - and ushered in a new era
of literacy and communication. Printing books was now orders of
magnitude cheaper, and there was an explosion of publishing. The
number of published books leapt from an estimated 30,000 books <em>in all
of Europe in 1450</em> to 12 million books by 1500.  Think about that. A
decent sized library today, in many large towns in England will have
30,000 books.  More than were in the whole of Europe before the
printing press. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Within a generation literacy in Western Europe had leapt from under 2%
to well over 20% - and it changed everything. Martin Luther was able
to nail a piece of paper to a church door and expect most members of
the middle-class congregation to simply read it, not have it read to
them by clergy. Books on mathematics and navigation enabled the
training of middle-class merchantmen who would then dare, only 40
years later, to cross the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Literacy en mass changed the course of human history and gave a tiny
corner EurAsia some huge advantages the effects of which are only just
wearing off five centuries later.</p>
<p>Before people wandered off to the bar I decided to let them know why
they were getting my best Simon Scharma impression.</p>
<p>Because, in my view, and remember they were eating my sausage rolls,
so that counts, in my view we are entering the age of a new form of
literacy - <em>software literacy.</em></p>
<p>Even in the 15th century, nations, companies and guilds and churches
competed, and ran international concerns. But somewhere between
Gutenberg&#8217;s Bible and Luther&#8217;s 95 Theses these companies changed. Not
with business process reengineering, or total quality circles - but
changed like leaving the water and walking on land changed. I have no
idea how to quantify the advantages a company whose staff can all read
and write will have over a company whose staff are illiterate. It&#8217;s
not one of lower labour cost, or better marketing, it&#8217;s something
else...Deep in our bones we <em>know</em> that literacy changes everything.
Its so built into us and into everyone we know that we cannot imagine
a world where we cannot read or write.</p>
<p>Anyway, you, like the poor people wanting to get to the bar, can see
where I am taking this. The ability to marshall knowledge, to code and
compile and compute, the natural inclination to arrange the world so
it can be iterated over, the ability to turn a business from a
medieval scriptorium into an operating system is software literacy.</p>
<p>The final shape of a software literate company is probably unguessable
to us, in the same way that an airports departures board was
unguessable to Pope Pius II, or that a major newspaper run by
illiterate editors will look and work nothing like the Washington
Post. But we can be sure they are coming. And we can make sensible
predictions about what they will and won&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>And so, as the Meetup wanders back to the bar slightly shocked, we
wander back to our theme.</p>
<p>Software literacy for a company does not mean that it just hires a lot
of programmers, and calls the job done.  Thats been happening for a
long time and yet few companies manage to evolve.  I am hoping to
describe in this book a vision of a company <em>that does not exist yet</em>.
A truly literate company, in a world of other softwre literate
companies.  We cannot know for sure the shape such companies will
take - they will jostle and change in a complex dance of evolution,
but we can look at both positive and negative data we have today - how
companies have failed to act in a sane / literate manner, and how some
fundamentals of software literacy are shining thorugh and will be
unavoidable in the future.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">When I speak of a literate company, please keep this film in mind.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&#8216;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8217; is one of my favourite films, engrossing and
suspenseful.  And it also portrays life in a deeply literate company.</p>
<p>I will take a leap and argue that the Washington Post under Ben
Bradlee was the epitome of a (non-software) literate company.  It had
well trained professionals, clear ethical standards, clear business
processes and clear processes for ensuring that its literate output
met their standards. Editors and copy-sub-editors and so on.  Oh, and
cashflow. That helped a lot.</p>
<p>I suggest that even companies like tech-behemoth Google are not really
software literate ... yet. But the clues are there. In the excellent
SRE book (link) author (link) the &#8220;founder&#8221; of SRE in Google, defines
SRE as &#8220;SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design
an operations team&#8221;.  As we go forward we shall find the software
literate companies are what happens when software engineers design
(found, run, populate and evolve) companies.  The flush of unicorns
today in Silicon Valley are nearly software literate - the effort of
founding a company is so huge that it&#8217;s hard to believe that what
results is what a software engineer would design. Things get missed.
But each generation of companies will steal from previous until the
majority of a company is what would be designed.</p>
<p>Does it make a difference - well let&#8217;s compare the old &#8220;knowledge
company&#8221; and the new. In 2012 <cite>Google</cite> had a revenue of $50bn and a
workforce of 40,000 - whereas the finance house <cite>Barclays
International</cite> also had a revenue of $50bn, but a far larger workforce
of 120,000.  Fast-forward to 2016 and <cite>Google</cite> has grown to $89bn and
70,000 people.  In the same year of 2016, <cite>Bank Of America</cite> posted
revenues of $89bn, and a workforce of over 200,000 people.  There are
many caveats comparing these numbers, but all the firms involved are
resolutely &#8220;knowledge-based&#8221; - the core processes of the firms do not
involve smelting iron ore or manufacturing cars.  And yet <cite>Google</cite>
carries 2/3 less humans for same revenue at each stage.  One of them
has used software in a markedly different manner.</p>
<p>One of them has become more <em>software literate</em>.</p>
<p>This might seem a silly question, big ones are more successful.  But
actually, imagine if you could have Google&#8217;s revenue&#8217;s but only have 2
or 3 employees, (working <em>very</em> hard!).  Well that would be the
sensible choice.  So the extra people must be there for a good reason.
But you would not add <em>more</em> people than needed.  That would cut the
amount of loot to go round.  So there must be counter-vailing forces,
pushing and pulling for hiring or reducing people.</p>
<p>I will discuss Roald Coase and his theory of the firm in detail later,
but its worth noting that there are several forces pushing and pulling
firm size (both employee and &#8220;volume&#8221;).  And those forces are changing
- a lot.  Firms will add more and more automation for their internal
processes, changing the number of people needed, as well as the speed
of abosorbing change.  I call this a <cite>programmable company</cite>.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/portrait_of_merchant_jan_gossaert.png"><img alt="_images/portrait_of_merchant_jan_gossaert.png" src="_images/portrait_of_merchant_jan_gossaert.png" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">A dutch 16th century trader pointing at his accounts books
Jan Gossaert (Washington National Gallery)</span></p>
</div>
<p>My conjecture is that we are hitting a limit on what tracking company
processes through accounting can do to limit wasteful (coase)
growth.  The 16th Century Trader shown above is a good exmaple of
how proud rich merchants were of their new &#8220;system&#8221; - accounting. Yes, 500 years ago,
accountatants were cool.</p>
<p>Accounting was a generic approach that could be used to control <em>any</em> form
of business.  And by the industrial revolution it had become globally accepted and
slowly stadnardised.</p>
<p>But a new generic approach is slowly being developed now - software. A
virtual world that can be measured as easily as money can be counted
but is more granular, and precise.  Software based metrics.</p>
<p>And this is my definition of a programmable company - where all
processes are visible in the virtual world</p>
<p>The brilliant mid-twentieth century Economist <cite>Roald Coase</cite> gave us a
fascinating way to model why companies and organisations are the size
they are - a Theory of the Firm.  We shall dive deeper into this later
on but as more and more processes become visible in the virtual, as we
practise &#8216;topless computing&#8217;, then we shall see dramatic shifts in the
size and shape of our organisations.</p>
<p>I think there is another interesting way to look at Coase firm size -
its to do with the cost of <em>trusting data</em>.  If data is published
internally, or from a <em>trusted third party</em> (lets say Reuters) there
is a limited amount of double checking needed.  Rumour is aproblem in
all companies, but Fake News is not. But with smaller and smaller
companies, the cost of finding and <em>trusting</em> data increases.</p>
<p>The fight against fake news is going to be a long defining one in
years to come.  The most obvious way is simply to revert back to the
old saw &#8220;You can have your own opnion, but not your own facts&#8221;. The
KGB lead approach to destroying this is to put so many fake facts, so
much chaff, that people just reinforce their own biases.  SOme method to
validate real geniuine facts against fake facts is within reach.
We can see how cameras could sign images, how articles published could be
cryptographically signed and stored, how facts marked up in the text.</p>
<p>ANd so how news aggregators (sorry advertising companies) like Google and Facebook
could use that to mark fake news as such.</p>
<p>SOme method to validate inferences from a <em>selection</em> of facts.  Well.
Thats harder. Hell, Human Politics might be defined as that problem.</p>
<p>As such the current privacy, GDPR world is not merely a lefy liberal
problem. It is a major factor in form size, market efficency and the
underlying fundamentals of</p>
<p>How do I know - well, as a software literate person, its just obvious.</p>
<p>Is fake news really a problem inside companies. Let me tell you a
story. Names have been changed to protect the guilty</p>
<p>Project - codebase begins, insufficiency for purpose, no one admitting
to it because if so then get fired.  The project management process
allowed for ... lies. Yes it passes, kind of.  any outside scrutiny-
day by a news reporter - would trivially see a problem. But no the
fake news carries on up</p>
<p>size makes this harder simply because at each step the ability to take time and challenge fake news is harder - and made worse by the culture of productivity/ hazing of directors</p>
<p>so we need automated helpnto dosciver fake news in our own project reporting</p>
<p>and that means trusting / managing the code</p>
<p>this inefficient is argued it is what brought down soviet - what all doctoaros suffer from (see saudi air force) - and we love it in our own companies??</p>
<p>We are already seeing calls for the software industry to regulate
itself, on privacy, on deals with repressive regiemes.  The answer is
not as simple as coders all being nice people.  But society needs to
regulate and also accept change.  We shall see that in section 2.</p>
<p>But companies, governments and organisations of every stripe, will need to adapt
to a new set of technologies that have a grain, a direction of travel, ... a tidal force.
Those techologies are here now, and our old organisational structures are no longer
sufficent.</p>
<p>Lets look at it this way - Facebook, if it took all 1.5 BILLION users
and moved to a new land mass would be the worlds largest
country. Ever.</p>
<p>And it would be the least democratic. Ever. A one man dictatorship. No
law courts, no police, no constitution.  Nada.  And yet every Facebook
app-using citizen would have more daily contact (what 3 hours a day?)
with its &#8220;government&#8221; than they ever had with their proper governments.</p>
<p>Each day we see some new controversy, YouTube failing to police its
comments section against paedophiles, (find more examples).  This is not because
Facebook is inherently evil, but because we are moving our lives online - and
<em>some</em> people moving online <em>are</em> inherently evil. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>So companies, governments, organisations, the structures we all spend
so much of our lives working within, need to change to get the best
out of the new technologial opportunity we face.</p>
<p>Because it could be a golden future for humanity.  Honest.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<div>&#8220;Writing is nature’s way of showing us how sloppy our thinking is.&#8221;
Leslie Lamport</div></blockquote>
<p>I very happily recounted my &#8220;Literacy started with the printing press,
software literacy starts with the Internet&#8221; meme in the last chapter.
I was rather proud of my little self, right up until I attended
<cite>Sprint 16</cite> the UK Government&#8217;s annual conference on tech and software
and government.  And the Minister for the Cabinet Office stood up and
gave a keynote that was basically the speech I gave so many years
prior in a London pub basement.</p>
<p>Nothing stops you feeling smug like national politicians spouting the
same ideas as you.</p>
<p>But the thing is, we are both right.  Although his suit was better.</p>
<p>The first mass-literacy revolution ran roughly in parallel with the
Commercial and Industrial Revolutions in Europe.  But apart from the
usual things we associate with literacy, things like sharing ideas
widely, democratic access to knowledge and so on, the one that is
often <em>missed</em> is that ideas have to be much more precisely expressed
when you write them down.  If you go around making speeches, each
person can walk off with different ideas as to what you said but
writing it down means it is waaay harder to mistake what you meant.</p>
<p>WIth software this applies to the n&#8217;th degree. There is no longer any
forgiving human mind in the way of your writing to work out what you
really meant. Software is unforgiving. The compiler will do what you
tell it.  And this means we shall have to write down what we really
mean.</p>
<p>This is going to be a problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>self driving car issue</li>
<li>access to agorithms</li>
<li>gorillas AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Some computer vision AI software failed to see black women as human
faces - accurately reflecting the cultural make up of the AI
laboratory it sprang from.  And we shall have to solve the multiutude
of robotic actions in the real world that were previosuly left to
chance.  See the chapter on self-driving cars for example.</p>
<p>So software literacty is not just a nice fluffy teach the world to
code idea.  It is going to be a fundamental questioning of every
aspect of our society and assumptions.  And we will need much much
better at resolving those conflicts - large scale democratic politics
does not seem to be good at this. Although, as per Churchill, it is a
<em>lot</em> better than all the others.</p>
<p>I do not see this as some portent of doom. More that we are <em>already</em>
in a world too sophisticated for any one mind to understand.  We rely
utterly on the expertese, and indeed munificence of others.  Its just
that the procedures for all these are still hidden and opaque. Partly
because it is commercailly beneficial, but the vast majority of the
time it is just the processes have not been made into software, and so
are not accessible.</p>
<p>Some companies are more software literate than others. It is hard to
define this but we can see some outlines in the fog.  They are
basically around a quote from Googler &lt;name&gt;</p>

a company, and it breaks its own literacy.</p>
<div class="section" id="knight-capital">
<h3>Knight Capital<a class="headerlink" href="#knight-capital" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Knight Capital should have been software literate.  It was a new
company, built to operate in the high-frequency trading world of US
equities, and had invested heavily in programmers and computers</p>
<p>Their business model was <em>market making</em> - buying shares from someone
who wanted to sell, waiting a bit, and selling them to someone who
wanted to buy. Market making is a valued part of all exchanges, and
way back, when the Exchange gave a priviledged few the right to be
market makers (for a fee of course) it was a very profitable exercise.
However as new market makers were granted access, such as Knight
Capital, the profits dropped (good for buyers and sellers, such as our
pension funds) and the competition sped up - slow market makers did
not get to trade with anyone.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital released a new version of their
software. And did so in a partly-manual manner.  Those words, &#8216;not
automated&#8217; make those who are software literate shudder.  Imagine
having a book as a loose sheaf of papers, unbound.  You know its just
missing something.  Surely things will eventually get all muddled up.
And sure enough, at Knight Capital, they had left an old, debug
version of the code on one of their servers. Which now merrily started
placing <em>test</em> orders onto the <em>real</em> market.</p>
<p>Test orders, such as Buy high and Sell at a loss, and repeat 10,000
times in a few fractions of a second.</p>
<p>Knight Capital tried to turn off their mistakes, but 45 minutes later
(an eternity in HFT) they had mistakenly executed 4 million orders for
100+ stocks, and lost 440 million dollars, effectively bankrupting the
company.  Other players in the market had of course realised something
was wrong, and initially expected the orders to be turned off within
seconds. When it was not, they merrily took the winning side on all
Knight Capitals traded and pocketed the cash. No point turning down
free money is there?</p>
<p>Knight Capital&#8217;s process of getting software that had been written
correctly out and into the hands of users (ie the equivalent of
publishing) was broken.  A newspaper that could write brilliant
articles but struggled with the whole delivering bundles to street
vendors would not last long.</p>
<p>In software, this publishing is called a release, but its as vital as
the process of publishing and delivering paper was to the Post.
Companies I have worked in have had ranges of automated releases done
a few times a day, or manually a few times a year.  Guess who felt
more ... literate.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Knight Capital paid the full price for their
failure to control their literacy. However, this market imposed
discipline, which is societally a Good Thing, does not apply equally.
Goldman Sachs did a similar thing in 2016, sending broken orders.
Then instead of being forced to pay the price for their mistake, they
simply agreed with the exchange that those orders <em>did not count</em>,
reverted the changes and did not pay a billion for their own
education.</p>
<p>Thats simply wrong.  Remeber our nice fluffy liberal &#8220;everyone is
equal&#8221; values. That should apply to everyone.</p>

<div class="section" id="office-of-personnel-management">
<h3>Office Of Personnel Management<a class="headerlink" href="#office-of-personnel-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In June 2015, the US government agency &#8220;Office of Personnel
Management&#8221; announced it had suffered a data breach.  Starting in
March 2014, external hackers had breached the firewalls around the
agency and were able to access the personnel records of millions of
current and former government workers.  The agency collected many
things, like pay records, but also, held background checks on
employees who needed higher levels of security clearance - in short
they had the records that said you used to be a drug addict or
depressed. All the stuff they want to know about you in case it is
used to balckmail you.</p>
<p>This was it seems all stored on mainframes running COBOL.  And the
thing about storing data is that you must at minimum, encrypt it at
rest on disk.  This is like, using ink or folders or filing
cabinets. Its something you don&#8217;t even think about.  Not for stuff
that foreign governments can use to blackmail your Embassy staff with.</p>
<p>So lets get this clear.  Vital security information and pay records,
stored unencrypted on mainframes that are so old they cannot spell
encryption, and then the Chinese hackers get in.</p>
<p>This breach, discovered seemingly by accident when a computer
forensics firm was asked to preapre a demo, is not something solvable
by replacing credit cards.  It is probably America&#8217;s deepest national
security problem for the next few decades.  Well, one of them.</p>
<p>This is a defining moment in software professionalism.  The right move
for a professional and so the right move for a software literate
organisation, was to shutdown the impossible-to-secure mainframes and
announce a budget request and a migration plan.</p>
<p>Things like intrusion detection programs would have been good, but
thats just &#8220;normal best practise&#8221; not &#8220;professional ethics&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, why did the woman at the top (not likely a malicious actor) why
did she not take this action? Because of the degree of obfuscation?
Possibly. But the one thing that leaps out of OPM is the inabiliy to
enmcrypt on COBOL mainframes.</p>
<p>Perhasp Everything else is justifiable in the hindsight race.  But
when you simply cannot do the job ethics dictates you dont pretend and
carry on.</p>
<p>OPM shows us that one defining quality of software literacy will be
professional ethics. to quote Spiderman, &#8220;with great power comes great
responsibility&#8221;.  For the next generation at least, software literacy
will be unevenly spread throughout the world.  And the importance of
software to the world at large is so great that we should ensure those
who wield that importance are not just expected to be trustworthy, but
are monitored by their peers.</p>
<p>Professional Ethics still matters</p>

<h3>Target and Yahoo<a class="headerlink" href="#target-and-yahoo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Target and Yahoo make interesting case studies. Target in 2014 had
given a Air conditioning contractor access <em>into</em> their internal
network, from the A/C contractor&#8217;s own network.  So when the A/C
contractor was breached, the Target internal network was just a hop
away.</p>
<p>Target lost millions of credit card details, and, probably more
importantly lost their CEO because of the public reaction.</p>
<p>Yahoo, had attackers copy 1 Billion (image) email addresses and
passwords.  They only admitted it because they had to for SEC
rulings. (check)</p>
<p>Target is probably when software security failings first took a major
scalp.  Yahoo is probably the last.</p>

<h3>Healthcare.gov<a class="headerlink" href="#healthcare-gov" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As part of Barack Obama&#8217;s healthcare reforms (back pre-Trump, if you
can rememebr that far back) a government agency was tasked with
setting up a online exchange that would allow hundreds of millions of
Americans to search for and find the most suitable of the new
insurance contracts that were available.  The project was handled in
the usual manner, and as is usual for large software projects it
failed to achieve its goals.  THis was hugely embarrasing and
<em>actually meant a large scale political initiative was at risk because
software it depended on was badly written</em>. (THis in itself is a
seismic moment.)</p>
<p>So the while mess was put in the lap of one of the new Breed of
GOvernment Best-practise Digital Agency, who proceeded to rescue the
mess, using best practise appraches. (it was not an unalloyed success,
but it worked).  Famously the attitude used was boiled down to a quote
from a frustrated DevOps engineer, who during a fraught and well
populated project meeting asked &#8220;If I cannot deploy New Relic (a
systems monitoring system) I&#8217;m gonna punch somebody&#8221;.</p>
<p>WHilst violence in the workplace is obbiously forbidden, the teams it
seems divided along the lines of people who thought it was obvious to
use these new tools, and thus obvvious that someone banned from using
them should get driven to rage, and those who thought it was obvious
to follow the old, way.</p>
<p>THis dividing line is what i think of as the software literate line.
The point at which one thinks &#8220;WTF?&#8221; when looking at processes or
services.  The point at which a literate person would look at a
company or society that, for example, has a legion of clergymen, who
stand up in chilly expensive cathedrals, and read out political
declarations.  And say, &#8220;Why not just print them and nail them to the
church door so people can just read it themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the dividing line.  That is the sort of change to society
softeware literacy threatens.</p>

<h3>The programmable company<a class="headerlink" href="#the-programmable-company" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One theme I shall return to is the idea that companies and
organisations are simply means to organise humans - and that has lower
cost and friction than it used to with software intermediation.</p>
<p>To put it simply, almost everything that is done in a normal company
now can be automated, and the co-ordination of functions is an email
away.</p>
<p>For almost everything a company or organisation does a second time,
that can be automated or co-ordinated via software.  A company will
become a programmable entity.  Most if not all effort that goes into
todays software projects, goes not into creating new business logic, but into
finding the data, massaging it, guaranteeing it, handling exceptions, and fitting into the rest of the businesses weird ways.</p>
<p>But a programmable company, that has robust exception handling, that has open standards that are easy to fit into, that has trustable data,</p>

<p>None of these are purely technical foul-ups.  Where humans are

<p>It&#8217;s how would an illiterate person run the Washington Post.  Ben
bradlee</p>
<p>Healthcare.gov - one of the team responsible for the clean up of
healthcare.gov tells a story (YouTube). He explains. But mostly he
says they did nothing clever, they invented nothing new. They just ran
best practises (the famous new relic punch).</p>
<p>But why did they run best practises and not others. There are many
explanations, multiple gov contractors, sclerotic practises etc. but
ultimately the people at the top looked at a newspaper that was run as
it would be run by an illiterate and said &#8220;well I can&#8217;t see how else
it should run&#8221;, because they were illiterate too.</p>

<p>So as we know what is wrong, it is useful to dive into why, and what

<p>There is a new round of crypto-wars going on (see Obama speech &#8220;absolutist&#8221;)
But this is part of wider discussion around meaning of privacy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a privative</p>
<p>It&#8217;s based in secure in ones home - constitution</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at ambient computing.
Intelligent context aware programming</p>
<p>Scenario: I walk from my kitchen to the living room, and the music I had playing dims in kitchen
And starts up in living room speakers.  I say &#8220;house! Something more dinner jazz please, and dim the lights&#8221;</p>
<p>Now to do this I must have computer monitoring me and my voice
It must stream music, electric usage will dip.</p>
<p>How can I defend my privacy?
Do I really care ?
Prevention of annoyance?
My music tastes probably say only a little politically
but what films I watch, what documentaries? Fox News or CNN ?</p>
<p>Social organisation and software
- software as it needs precision highlights a lot
For example conways law - social organisation of contributors reflects the software produced</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://hintjens.com/blog:112">http://hintjens.com/blog:112</a></p>

<p>Productivity :</p>
<p>The second biggest issue of our time
Basically the low hanging fruit of mechanisation has gone.</p>
<p>Productivity as measure of energy used to output</p>
<p>The future is more complex solutions to drive smaller increments in productivity until energy becomes orders magnitude cheaper or our usage orders more sophisticated</p>

<p>Most organisations hold back productivity- and fixing that will be hard</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>also remote working and competition across the globe</li>
</ul>
<p>Privacy:</p>
<p>The biggest issue of our time
The modern day pollution
The issue is who sets the laws
The issue is we must be regulated (murder)
The issue is we shall see Google become a utility in need of regulation - but under whose jurisdiction?</p>
<p>How in Europe do we set this? How in USA? What about China (monitoring all )</p>
<p>Privacy shield - max schremms</p>
<p>Audio visual media services directive - tv regulation. Country of origin country of destination</p>
<p>Unregulated is impossible
Light regulation means skills and information to deal with</p>
<p>The less regulation, the more transparency and individual tools to compensate</p>
<p>My view: it is harmful to insist on country of destination style solutions to regulation as these allow dictatorships to censor</p>
<p>We should have global agreements on base regulation (child pornogrpahy, hate speech etc) and enforce transparency - and it is upto destinations to educate and provide tools to support their choices.</p>

<p>This says <em>everything</em> I want to say about why Open Source Software is
important, why re-creating the existing work is important, why open
and transparent - ness works, why things need to be evovled not designed
and why, we cannot understand everything.</p>
<p>It takes a genius to put all that in 8 words.</p>
<p>So, what can be extracted from eight words.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build from scratch</li>
<li>Open Source keeps re-inventing the wheel</li>
<li>software is evolved</li>
<li>relax.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my software development tenets is you should be able to <em>build
your whole systems from scratch</em>.  That is given bare metal hardware,
get up and running, not from a few lucky backups and _dd_ but from
controlled scripted installs.</p>
<p>I have always thought this vital - without being able to (re)create
your systems, how do you know if you can in a disaster, or more
importantly that you can when it is not a disaster.  ITs impossible to
believe that the first time you installed your webserver you got it
perfect, first time, but if you cannot rebuild it with confidence, you
just will put off rebuilding it again and again until it is a mess of
libraries, patches and symlinks that you could never hope to remmeberm
nor worse, simplifiy.  Now expand that to your DNS, file server, your
database.</p>
<p>But being able to run a simple script, and the system is configured,
that makes life so much simpler.  I can read the script and see what it
will do.  I can change it, experiment, confident that I can just rerun
the original and get back to where I started.  And I can run the script
and go do something more interesting.</p>
<p>And no, I do not believe in _dd_, _ghost_ or other image based
methods.  Yes, they are very nice for Virtualisation, but always there
is a flaw - to get to an image, one has to build the original.  If you
build the original by hand, how do you know what steps you took - how
sure can you be? The Sysadmin was very careful?  Was he? Thats nice.
Oh look a new patch is out, and we no longer want to use version 5.2.2
of php and can we put the incompatible library onto only half of the
hosts.  Can you rebuild all of the images to do that, by tomorrow?
Still going to be careful are you?</p>
<p>Build from scripts, from scratch.</p>
<p>And you know what, I finally worked out why I was so insistent on this,
in the face of others desire to take the easy route.  Quite simply because
I did not understand a system till I had wrestled it enough to automate it.</p>
<p>You find out where all the gaps are when you try and automate a system.</p>
<p>I am (re)writing a ER diagramming tool, for about the third time. This time no
funny copyright issues with my employers, I swear.</p>
<p>But there are many ER tools out there. And there are many languages, databases,
games and more.  This does not stop us from writing another, just as
the existence of a Haynes car manual does not stop people from taking their
car engine apart.  We do it because we do not understand, and we want to learn.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is an itch to scratch.  But often the itch is for knowledge,
and the desire to know if we <em>can</em>.  Benefiting the rest of the world is what we
do to share our knowledge.</p>
<p>Because we have to re-invent the wheel to teach the next generation,
we tend to incrementally improve.  And that is a slow evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Software <em>evolves</em> to fit its niche.</p>
<p>I am sometimes troubled by comparing myself to some of life&#8217;s winners.  But
looking at Feynman makes those comparisons silly.  A genius that other genius&#8217;
thought a genius, he still tried to understand this strange world we live in,
and had no more a grasp on <em>why</em> than the rest of us poor schmucks.</p>
<p>So, we do what we can.  And move the world on a little bit.  Some more than
others, I must admit, but I am happy to be pushing it in the right direction.

Price of gold is fairly stable
==============================</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I do love me a bit of Ancient Rome.  And I love the term Solid - it came from the solidus, a gold coin minted by Constantine 315AD</p>
<p>Domain have done some amateur digging and will try the following: in Neros day 2 denarii would buy a Modius, which was sufficent grain for ten days for one average male (two one pound loaves a day, there is a diet to make wheat intolerant weep)</p>
<p>Now the aureus was replaced by the solidus, but it was about 25 denarii.  So we can say that one gold coin bought you about 100 -120 days worth of basic food.</p>
<p>A kuggerand is about four times the weight of gold as a aureus, and it&#8217;s about £1,000 to buy today. And at £3 per day I could carefully feed myself.  Certainly in bread alone.</p>
<p>So over nearly 2000 years, a gold coin is roughly enough to feed one man for three months.</p>
<p>Fascinating</p>

<div class="section" id="what-a-foul-up">
<h1>What a foul up<a class="headerlink" href="#what-a-foul-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So, I made a dick move yesterday. I misunderstood someone&#8217;s comment (or I misunderstood their intention) and ... well &#64;dang accused me of racewar and something about stone tablets and science.</p>
<p>I was of course outraged and reacted. Then a minute later I took a deep breath and reacted better.</p>
<p>We all value our reputation and having a judgement so clearly divergent from my own self perception has caused some internal reflection.</p>
<p>You see, there is an old joke about the definition of a liberal - a conservative who just got arrested.</p>
<p>Looking at my self in the mirror, I still see a sensible well balanced person, with strong liberal tendencies (who has worked at the UK version of ACLU, organised anti-intimidation watchdogs at voting booths in racially charge elections in London, and so on - things which while true when repeated here they still sound hollowly like &#8220;some of my best friends are&#8221;)</p>
<p>I am sure dang and the other hard working moderators see a lot of crap in their job.  I am of course <em>certain</em> that that was not what I meant - who me?</p>
<p>Except that one thing middle age teaches you is that, quite often, it is you.</p>
<p>So yes, when someone arrives with a Vote Trump T shirt they probably do not find HN an easy place to discuss things in the terms they usually use.  And they will I am sure always protest &#8220;but it was not me, but what I said was perfectly sensible debate / free speech, how dare you accuse me like that, gosh you should treat people better around here, I am off to Breightbart&#8221;</p>
<p>But just like the recently arrested conservative I want to say just that (well not the breightbart bit obviously, but I certainly felt ill-used. Especially the bit about &#8220;other breaches of the guidelines in my previous history&#8221;. Yeah gulp. I have asked for a list - in my case because I want to analyse and improve. Clearly those other cases where people ask they are just indignant)</p>
<p>But no matter what, I have been sorted into the basket of deplorables.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Did I make a mistake and step down the slippery slope thinking I had good grips on my shoes?</li>
<li>Did I not notice the slope?</li>
<li>Am I actually deplorable?</li>
<li>Or is it all the fault of those evil moderators ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually this last point is not fair. I have reread the post and - I really failed to convey my thoughts. What is posted there is ... a horrific comment. (I can remember what I meant. I can see where I missed out indicative punctuation. But thats not the point is it.) Totally not what I meant and hopefully would never ever think. But someone I respect has come back with &#8220;well thats not actually out of character for you Paul.  We were thinking of banning your account for some of the stuff you have said&#8221;.  That has shaken me deeply and I would like to know what has lead them there.  And how can I adjust my public statements to better reflect me.</p>
<p>So I herewith apologise to everyone on HN or elsewhere for posting text that reads so horrifically. Even if I did not mean it, I still wrote it.</p>
<p>I also need to think about why I post stuff too quickly, why I chose such am inflammatory subject to post on anyway, and why I did not review.</p>
<p>Fewer words. More thought.</p>
<p>I am going to take a bit of a break.</p>
<p>I have spent many years on HN (and am probably a little too anxious to be this close to 10,000).</p>
<p>Apart from satirical news shows on radio 4, it&#8217;s my main source of information on the world. (This may of course not be a great thing.)</p>
<p>So a break is called for - I check too often, and while Facebook is often criticised by us for its addictive-like properties, I still obsessively check HN morning and night and am sooo close to 10k and my last couple of submissions did feel more like testing the reactions for points, not sharing something.</p>
<p>(Actually re-re-re-reading my offending post I can see I meant to put a question mark (or more ??!!) at the end of the first paragraph - so a challenge to the poster looks a lot like a statement of .. oh fuck me what a disaster.  I was remembering what I meant, not reading what I actually wrote.  It really does read like a trolling post - I can quite see what happened there.  But the &#8220;other posts violating our guidelines&#8221; indicates its a good time to take a break till I have processed things.)</p>

The Journey of Mikado Software
==============================</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="the-journey-to-freedom">
<h3>The journey to freedom<a class="headerlink" href="#the-journey-to-freedom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I was made redundant in 2008, from a nice CTO job in London&#8217;s City, at the
height of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Now, I have worked in the &#8220;Internet Industry&#8221; since 1995.  Yes I am that old.
And I have done most jobs, from CTO to consultant, Developer to DBA.  I ran some
of the UK&#8217;s first ADSL trials back when 14.4 modem was a big deal, have written
software for the FTSE100 and the footie club.  And so I decided not to take
it lying down.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I walked into a new contracting job, and I hustled, and hunted,
worked my way up the salary ladder, started my own consultancy and landed the
<em>big gig</em>.</p>
<p>It was the worst move I ever made.</p>
<p>I sat in a car for between 2 and 4 hours a day (and I never knew how long the
trip would be).  And I was not curing cancer so I could hardly claim my work was
worth the sacrifice.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="assets/images/m25.jpg" src="assets/images/m25.jpg" />
</div>
<p>I saw my children only when they were asleep, or at weekends, when I was
exhausted. My wife saw me for about ten minutes before we climbed into bed and
slept shattered.  It put strains on my marriage and our kids.</p>
<p>And I put on nearly two stone.</p>
<p>So, as that contract ended, I swore to stop.  I did not need to actually be in an office, watched to see if I was slacking off.  I could work remotely, from
anywhere, for anyone.</p>
<p>And things turned a corner.  I was able to walk into
work, able to make breakfast for my kids, let my wife have a lie in and a cuppa.[#]_</p>
<p>It is not heaven, bills still need to be paid, relationships repaired, the office is tiny.</p>
<p>But like nearly 3 out of 4 workers, my job does not need to involve me
travelling to the same office as everyone else.  Nearly 75% of us could do the
same job from <em>anywhere</em>.  And we could do it minutes from our families, our
lives.</p>
<p>The more of us who make that break, who escape, the more our societies will
shift.  Till raising a family stops being a struggle that tears us from being
productive in work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-journey-for-freedom">
<h3>The journey for freedom<a class="headerlink" href="#the-journey-for-freedom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of the next decade of the Internet is
the vast, vast amount of data that will be available, and the new insights
that data will afford us.  But it is too much data for any one company to
own it and use it.  All the pharamceutical companies will need to share their results to find the next break throughs, all the financial companies will need to
share their trades to avoid the next crash.</p>
<p>Data will have to be <em>open</em> to be <em>big</em> and with that will come the open software to handle the data, and the open forms of working (like above) that will
be used to write the software.</p>
<p>And this is my second journey - I am a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oss4gov.org/manifesto">passionate believer</a> in the role of open source in public sector
software.  Mikado Software is driven to put high quality, open software into
government and public sector hands.  We are not a lone voice, the new NHS Spine2 will be built on the open source Python language (a speciality of Mikado) and the Government Digital Service is not just revamping websites, but pushing the
very defintion of Open and Agile into the heart of UK government.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="journey-s-end">
<h3>Journey&#8217;s End<a class="headerlink" href="#journey-s-end" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I care passionately about my family, which makes me not unique.  I also care
passionately that governments, councils and citizens all have the right to read
the software that more and more runs our lives.  The right to read it, critique
it, and one day remove the offending code.  Just as we do with our written laws
today.</p>
<p>Software matters now, and will matter more in the future.  It need to be kept
free and open so the laws that run our lives are as accessible as the laws that
govern us.</p>
<p>Mikado Software is the end of two journeys, a company that treats work that can
be done anywhere as an opportunity to work anywhere, and a company that creates
the future of public services.</p>

<h2>Not nearly as much fun as it sounds<a class="headerlink" href="#not-nearly-as-much-fun-as-it-sounds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The other day I was asked by a member of staff if it would be possible to tie
the holiday spreadsheet into the master workplanner application.</p>
<p>Now <em>possible</em> is a horrible word for IT people, because it is <em>always</em>
possible.  Its really a question of is it a good idea.</p>
<p>I said, well, not until the holiday recording was taken out of spreadsheet form
and put into something that was less ... topless.</p>
<p>Yes, I got the eyebrow reaction.</p>
<p>However it does make sense.  We do not know what the future is going to hold, so
it is always sensible to put our data and code into a form that makes it easy /
simple / feasible to build another system on top of it.</p>
<p>In other words we should build our systems to be <strong>top-less</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, like in the real world, there are varying degrees of topless.  A
spreadsheet is possible to extract data from.  Perhaps I could write a
Python-server that looked at Excel at one end and spat out HTML / JSON the
other. But then I need to map employeeIDs between excel and this other thing,
and write some interpreter for the weird way the spreadsheet deals with time,
and it would probably be a good idea to cache the dates for speed, which means a
storage engine, and by this time I have written yet another half-assed
application, that still does not handle half-days sick, nor talk to the payroll,
nor know anything about regulations.</p>
<p>But to get rid of it will mean <em>me</em> going off finding a list of decent payroll
applications, and asking if they are topless.</p>
<p>Which always makes for a fun phone call.</p>
<p>To me <strong>topless computing</strong> is really, truly <strong>user-friendly</strong> software.  But by
that I assume there are computer literate users being considered.  Because
user-friendly does not mean it has a nice UI, it does not mean it has predictive
text.  It means that when I want to extend it, it does not get in the way.
(Some describe this as difference between <em>plumbing</em> and <em>porcelain</em>).</p>
<p>If all users could write source code, all programs would be topless. Or at least
have easy to remove bikinis. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id4">[3]</a> And that is ultimately why I go around talking
about topless computing.</p>
<p>Because it sounds naughty.</p>
<p>European topless computing directive - the idea that this accessibility needs to be enforced as a competitive need. Owning up banking like PSD2

<p>Also: We must include political biases when &#8220;asking a software engineer to designing a company&#8221; - look at openness and transparency in project reporting or in open source code reviews etc</p>

Excellent take on coase minimum</p>
<p>So in modern world the process is thenthings - a single slip up causes horro - something a s project mange I know too well.  Approvals ...</p>
<p>And so what is needed is solutions to this - continuous integration is tried - but this is fixing things after they gone wrong - just really quickly after they go wrong</p>
<p>Apples vaunted process is to model the process correctly first</p>
<p>And this is my argument for the new company - the programmable company is one where all the interactions are programmed and viable in pre-production allowing choice, optimisationand modelling</p>

starts haveing serious consequesnces is my view ofr the coase minimum</p>
<p>An interesting blog by google about manifesto</p>
<p>Idea was as got further on in career stopped doing the coding and
started doing the &#8220;what needs to be done and how&#8221; stuff</p>
<p>But this is precisely what a market is good at.</p>
<p>Looking at my experience of large companies an awful lot of management
(risk and project) is just competing with other people to be first to
look viable and have a following - thisnis ridiculous Ina centrally

<h2>Ask a Software Engineer to design Project Management<a class="headerlink" href="#ask-a-software-engineer-to-design-project-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>&lt;Name&gt;, an influential Googler who helped popularise the idea of
Software Reliability Engineer (SRE) said &#8220;SRE is what you get when you ask a
developer to design an Operations process.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, this entire book can be boiled down to &#8220;Software Literate companies is what you get when you ask a developer to design a company&#8221;.</p>
<p>But lets just look at one (important) aspect of a company - <em>Project
Management</em>.  Fundamentally, work inside a company can be divided into
two parts - <em>running the company</em> and <em>changing (improving?) the
company</em>.</p>
<p>Running the company is just the day-to-day
business-as-usual processes.  Opening up the store, stocking the
shelves etc.  (and yes, very amenable to automation).</p>
<p>Changing the company is usually harder.  It is a search process usually, looking for product-market fit for early stage companies, or later stage companies loking for efficencies etc.</p>
<p>And CHanging the company is almost always coralled into <em>projects</em>.  As such automating project management will be very very helpful.</p>
<p>And as we are designgin a softweare literate company, we dhall desing a compny that is mostly automated, and driven by software - and as such changing the software means changing the company.</p>
<p>Lets repeat that - changing the codebase, means changing a company. And if changing the codebase is now project management, then project management should flow <em>from</em> gthe codebase.</p>
<div class="section" id="software-literate-project-management">
<h3>Software Literate Project Management.<a class="headerlink" href="#software-literate-project-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I am embarrassingly bad at traditional Project management.
Co-ordination, keeping an eye on the most important parts.  Basically
I assume that if i know something, then everyone else knows it too.
So there would be no point in telling other people about
it. Co-ordinating. for example.  Also my timekeeping sucks which tends
to piss everyone off eventually. (Such as the woman I left waiting at
the Cinema so long, the film actually finished before I got
there. There wasn&#8217;t a second date.  Not sure why I am sharing, but you
get the idea. Manual project management is a skill I really want to
automate away.)</p>
<p>So what can a codebase do that is <em>better</em> than manual project managers?
Better than teams of &#8220;change specialists&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, lets start with lying.  People lie. Everyone lies. If your
husband asks if this sweater makes him look fat round the middle, you
say &#8220;no darling&#8221;.  If your boss&#8217; boss asks if the project is going to
be ready on time, you are <em>optimistic</em>.  You don&#8217;t for example,
recommend a regieme of salads, beans and cutting out the chocolate
biscuits while running 2 miles a day.  You dont say the code base is
crap, the test coverage laughable and the specifications so vague we
still dont know what the goal is.</p>
<p>No, you lie. So your boss thinks its ok. And meerily everyone trundles along
kind of hoping everything will work out all right.</p>

<p>Part of the challenge for a simple IT manager is to keep abreast of an ever changing landscape without falling into the twin tarpits of hype and cool.</p>
<p>No-one can be in this business for long without seeing the next big thing whizz past us like a dead bunny with a jetpack.  But inured as we maybe to the sort of hype that got me buying textbooks on marimba and push technology in &#8216;98, it takes many years to notice the plausibly disguised tarpits and not spotting them can waste time money and effort vanishing down dead ends.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, as I am talking about future trends, I am officially sanctioned not to use the phrase &#8216;paradigm shift&#8217;, a crime for which the gulags beckon.</p>
<p>For IT managers there are four major changes coming</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Disks are becoming tapes</li>
<li>Parallel programming</li>
<li>Information security is as busted as DRM</li>
<li>Everything else, probably involving privacy.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="disks-are-becoming-tapes">
<h3>Disks are becoming tapes<a class="headerlink" href="#disks-are-becoming-tapes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>How big can a hard disk get?  I have got several 500GB disks, and can now buy 1TB disks, which considering I remember saving up for a 16*Kilobyte* expansion pack for my ZX80 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id6">[4]</a> is quite terrifying.  However, the bods from Seagate believe that, just like light waves put a limit on how small a transistor can be photo-etched onto silicon, similar electro-magnetic theories limit the size of a 5 1/4&#8221; hard disk - but we shall reach 20TB before that becomes a manufacturing restraint.</p>
<p>Now for a randomly fragmented hard disk of 20TB the access time for any piece of data is quite slow compared to the total size of the disk.  This ratio has been increasing for a while, and it has some serious implications.</p>
<p>The amount of data a disk can output depends on 2 things, the <em>transfer rate</em> or how quickly it can pull data from under the head and out to the rest of the PC, and how quickly it can find the data on the disk. This last one is important.
Disks can now hold 1TB and will grow to 20TB. They can sustain transfer rates of about 50MegaBytes/s, but even high end disks take 5 milliseconds to find a particular location on the disk <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id7">[5]</a></p>
<p>Lets say we want to pull off mp3 files, snippets of conversation from my life. At a seek time of 5ms, I can get to 200 <em>locations</em> a second.  This is not the same as 200 files a second - it will be snippets of files, chunks that have to be pulled off and reassembled.  Today this does not matter much, but with a 20TB disk, and we choose a file fragment size of say 5KB that is retrieved each access, I have a throughput not of 50MB/s but 1MB/s.  That is 20TB / 1MB or 20 million seconds to retrieve the whole disk. That&#8217;s 231 days by the way.</p>
<p>This is obviously a worst case style example, but if we continue to use hard disks as we have been in my career, then it will take that long to read a disk.  Obviously madness, so when we write to the disk we will have to think about the use of the the data later on.  Thats unheard of today.  Its back to magnetic tapes.</p>
<p>We will fill these disks. Not just with cute otters on youtube, but with our lives; emails, phone conversations, videos from our camera equiped eyeglasses (and if you think that is unlikely look at urban cyclists, there is a growth in cameras recording the daily commute ready to send in for that all important insurance claim against the driver who just hit you).  We shall go back to a time when the application developer had to think where on a tape the data was stored.</p>
<p>So disks will stop becoming random access and more than likely be time sequential storage.  Which is fine when I am looking for my phone conversation from the 22nd of August.  But it has a problem when I want all the phone calls I made to my wife, in which I mentioned taking the cats to the vets.  The implications for this are quite huge, programmers today live in a world of random access (this is one half of the reason for dominance of the relational database model).  To end that will require massive mindset changes, and we programmers are by and large a conservative lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parallel-programming">
<h3>Parallel programming<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-programming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With one massive change to the way programmers think already coming down the line, the next one is a doozie.</p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s law is, for its kind, a famous dictum.  It basically states that the processing power of a chip doubles every 18mths.  Understanding this law is widely held to be one reason Microsoft defeated Lotus in the speadsheet market <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id8">[6]</a> - Bill Gates decided to go for the best new features even if it ran slowly, gambling that in time the chips would be twice as fast.  Lotus meantime tried to speed up their spreadsheet in the code, and the market chose the new features of Excel now running at acceptable speeds.</p>
<p>Moore&#8217;s law has traditionally been implemented by chip manufacturers like Intel making transistors on silicon smaller each generation so squeezing more into a chip.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the wavelength of light is making it difficult to do this any more, so chip manufacturers are basically cheating, keeping the size of the transistors the same but putting twice as many on there.  To get twice as many transistors to work really means two CPUs.  The problem with this is that a single CPU is in essence linear, one instruction at a time.  Programs were written with this in mind, and now,  what worked for Microsoft in the late eighties stops.  If I write my clever new, slow program, in 18 months it will still be just as slow  - it works in a linear fashion, is designed in a linear fashion and so will only run on one CPU.  That power doubling stops.</p>
<p>Intel have already announced a 32 core chip.  Now if I take the Lotus approach and optimise my slow code for multile CPUs, I will run my applications upto 32 times faster than the guy down the road.  I do not know what competitive advantage I can get from that, but it must exist.  In short, what worked for Bill Gates 20 years ago, seems to be stopping now.  There will be no free speed up in 18 mths.</p>
<p>There are new languages designed to handle these parallel programming worlds, they are a odd and hither too little trodden world of <em>functional programming</em>, with Lisp as the poster child.  However two new languages best represent the choices ahead - Erlang, which passes messages between nodes and essentially shares nothing between these cores, and Haskell which does something clever with shared memory which frankly I do not understand. And there in lies the rub, as these are new languages, new <em>paradigms</em> (there I said it), and they need massive shifts in how people think and work - and again programmers are slow to pick up new things.  Really new things that is.</p>
<p>Either way, to tackle the parallel programming world, programmers will need to learn a completely new class of languages. And look how long it took to go from C to C++ to Java, which basically was objects, then garbage collection. (about 30 years. Can we wait another 30?  Or perhaps there is competitive advantage in Erlang?)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tarpits">
<h3>Tarpits<a class="headerlink" href="#tarpits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here we can see tarpits forming, and it is worth commenting on their likely shape too.</p>
<p>There are already rumblings about Intel and others developing compilers that will parallelise your program for you, meaning the programmer does not have to think about the problems of running his app on 300 CPUs in different time zones, it just happenns. Yeah, and the crack Royal Air Force Porcine Display team is putting on a show at an airfield near you.  So much effort is being expended to stop us from having to learn a new thing.  That&#8217;s not in line with the idea that computers are tools, not gadgets and we need to learn to use them.</p>
<p>Both the above lead to the much heralded Grid computing - we will treat computing like we treat electricity - ubiquitous and commoditised.</p>
<p>I just do not beleive it.</p>
<p>I can see how already commoditised services will be gridified - but lets face it the reason organisations use IT is two-fold: to not lose cost advantages from not doing what everyone else does (the move from letters and memos to email) and to gain competitive advantage by doing something better than others.</p>
<p>The first one will be gridified - if your email system works like everyone else&#8217;s, you do not lose out.  But most of the driving force for new IT is to gain a competitive advantage - to be able to do what others cannot.  And that can, by definition, not be commodity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-security-is-as-busted-as-drm">
<h3>Information security is as busted as DRM<a class="headerlink" href="#information-security-is-as-busted-as-drm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I have an important database in the office, with lots of important data. If the competition finds this data we could lose sales, if the tax authorities find it we could lose the CFO, and if the press find it we could lose the CEO.  So it is important not to let anyone copy it, or take it out of the building.</p>
<p>That is suddenly not so easy anymore.  Mobile phones, PDAs, remote working, on the road, laptops and home offices all mean that the data needs to go to where the people are.  I can encrypt the data as it travels over the network, but the only way someone can work on it is if it is decrypted at their end.  This is the same as a DRM protected song can be as encrypted as you or EMI like, but at some point it needs to be played through my earphones.  At that point someone can copy it, both the songs and the tax data.  And lets face it if it can be copied and has a value, it <em>will</em> be copied. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id9">[7]</a></p>
<p>There is an attempt to control this - Microsoft is trying the &#8216;&#8217;&#8216;Trusted Computing&#8217;&#8216;&#8217; approach - where the hardware is locked and prevented from running anything Microsoft (and by extension the IP owner) does not want run. However it has been a damp squid so far, and even Apple the most successful hardware-controlled-by-someone-not-the-owner approach is trying to persuade the music business to stop mucking around.
And what is failing in the consumer market will fail harder in the business market - the question to be framed is &#8216;&#8217;&#8216;You want me to buy a laptop that can stop the MD from viewing his own sales data if Microsoft decides he is breaching copyright ? This being a man who cannot print from Word every other week?  Yeah, let me get my cheque-book.&#8217;&#8216;&#8217;</p>
<p>My data is not secure when it leaves my little data-castle.  And yet everyone wants to work away from the office, on their iphone, in the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="privacy">
<h3>Privacy<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is vanishing, or rather, the assumptions we used to have about privacy no longer match reality.  Most of my conversations were assumed to be private and <em>ephemeral</em> <a href="#id20"><span class="problematic" id="id21"><span id="id10"></span>[#]_</span></a>, and because they were between two or three people they were.  But when the conversations are on email, or recorded by someone&#8217;s iphone or life-corder in their glasses, that stops.  Am I to be held to my every whittered word (even the ones on this site I would be happy to stay a bit more ephemeral.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hype and the Next Big Thing are always around us, and spotting the difference between real faultlines and over-hyped faultlines is a difficulty, but one we must all learn.

<p>that&#8217;s not the argument the article was making - they note that tech and media (the fastest growing sectors, which not coincidentally employ most intensively IT workers) are just 5% of economy.</p>
<p>the argument is that when the rest of the economy employs IT at the same level of intensity, the remaining 95% will have similar productivity growth and hence see gains of wealth creation.</p>
<p>we then have to work out how to distribute those gains (hopefully fairly and equitably)</p>
<p>There is a oft quoted parallel with electricity replacing steam in factories- it took a generation or more for factories to stop being clustered around one large steam engine, running each corner of the factory to the speed of one central spindle.  the idea is that eventually companies will adapt to use &#8220;Digital&#8221; rather than adapting digital to fit them.=======================================
Serverless - not another paradigm shift
=======================================</p>
<p>According to Bill Bryson in his remarkable &#8220;A Short History of nearly
Everything&#8221;, renowned Paleontologist Simon Conway-Morris was
cataloging the incredible diversity of body-types that had appeared in
an evolutionary instant during the Pre-Cambrian Explosion 500 million
years ago. Dozens of bizzare new body types (lets put claws on the end
of a nose, that might work!). Morris reportedly opened a drawer of
previously un-categorized fossils and remarked &#8220;Not another fucking
phylum&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is a little how I feel with computing platforms and approaches in
our new century. A phylum you may have heard of is <cite>serverless
computing</cite>.</p>
<p>Its worth taking a moment on this one - it is going to be a tough
sell, but, like <cite>AR</cite>, I think its where the smart money will play.
And unlike AR, its not a new green field. This one requires us to
re-write a lot of enterprise code.  So it needs to offer some
advantages.</p>
<p>My evolution ...</p>
<p>Serverless computing is ... hard to explain. Let&#8217;s imagine you write a
function that takes an HTTP request with a key &#8220;name&#8221; and your
function returns &#8220;hello &lt;name&gt;&#8221;.  In the normal server-based world I
would know which server that would run on - I would have to worry if
it should run there or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Serverless simply has a scheduler that pushes the request and my
function to <em>any</em> server in a vast array</p>
<p>Issues
* security. You thought it was bad sharing a
* the solution here is run your own farm of machines. But that is expensive.</p>
<p>Serverless and functional. THis seems to be the winning combination.</p>
<p>Simon Wardley (we have already met him on business strategy) was
involved in an early serverless</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-fuss-serverless-simon-wardley">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-fuss-serverless-simon-wardley</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s another shift - findev</p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically event driven functions, or batch run functions.
But the concept is w don&#8217;t want to worry about a server before we want to run the function.</p>
<p>The biggest concern is security
The second biggest is where do I put my data</p>

<p>The landscape, climate and doctrine from sun-tau determine strategy and the ins and out Avery well</p>
<p>Doctrine - like a style guide or dev manual for developers</p>
<p>But the landscape of software is often seen as magic by the ore-literate
And it&#8217;s why algorithms matter</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s the two kinds of why - why this move instead of all the other moves possible. That means you need an understanding of all the possible moves and their future implications - why means a map.</p>

<h2>Simple to complex roadmaps<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-to-complex-roadmaps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Swardley??</p>
<p>One of the important things in software, perhaps the most important, is to keep things simple.
As the needs of an organisation grow, the complexity of the systems it uses increases.
I show here, in each section, a roadmap of complexity.  The base simplicity levels are
expected to give the fundamental understanding of the problems, but give way fgracefully to
new, (ope source) solutions that do the same thing as the simple system, but have extra more useful features.</p>
<p>FOr example, in configuration and co-ordination, we start with just a init file style API that reads from a text file
telling us what config data exists for our systems.  This is <em>fine</em> but it really quickly hits limits.
SOmething like APache Zookeeper is the next logical step, but that is waay more complicated to set up.
So we start witht he simplest possible, and point to where to take the next steps.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The economist Robert Solow once quipped that we see the benefits of
computers everywhere, at home, at work, except in the productivity
statistics.  It has been argued
(<a class="reference external" href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf">https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf</a>) that this
is because we are missing the essential rearrangement</p>
<p>Two productivity arguments - we aren&#8217;t inventing stuff or we don&#8217;t
have demand side drivers in western world - that is we can outsource
to cheap labour (Foxconn and Apple make iPhones) If we see 70s then
people invested massively as labour price was skyrocketing - similar
to post world war 1 (immigration, death etc)</p>
<p>Only when we absorb all human capacity to modern levels or social
changes</p>
<p>I think this is right - but it needs a little deeper
explanation. Let&#8217;s look at architects, project managers and
bricklayers</p>
<p>Also internet not changed as much as washing machine - we see the big
communications changes in telegraph. Internet is changing the consumer
(the out of work ways we spend our time)</p>
<p>But it is still hard to see it transforming the in work hours.  Web
technologies do appear everywhere - but this is a function of more
robots ready to build houses - if only the instruction were there.</p>
<p>We only need project managers because the architects were not precise
enough. So the replacement of the bricklayer will soon become the
replacemt of project manager - the great hollowing out.</p>
<p>But this cannot happen if a business is still the equivalent of a
blueprint - needing builders and somon to actually make it work.</p>
<p>Only a programmable company, can be designed like an architect designs
a building - and only at that point can we look at theory of firm. At
things trading on our behalf, at companies that can be formed - is
this insane? Maybe but that&#8217;s never meant wrong.</p>
<p>I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.  But we need
to look deeper</p>
<p>Software is not seeing the productivity gains it should.  But why?</p>
<p>Firstly we are not software literate as companies Not seeing right
size nor right interfaces</p>
<p>Second we are of seeing marketplace of companies to enable right
sizing But we can define what it is - code as the definition of all</p>
<p>Productivity gains held back by company structure, lack of code at all
levels</p>
<p>Architecture paradox - what we see as companies are not all the
decisions and functions needed - we are not seeing
everything. Software literate company will raise to level of explicit
code eachnof those activities - it will be real architecture to build.</p>
<p>A programmable company is one where all its activities and decisions
are encoded. See Apple and its runbook.  When asking for a quote &#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is a programmable company - where it&#8217;s decision processes are
both encoded, and adjustable by internal (direct coding) and external
(customers choosing or not choosing to buy, take action)</p>
<p>As much of facebooks actions, it&#8217;s resource allocation, are steered by
the mass actions of its user base. It is a vast AB test. Now inntheory
this is true of any company - if we stop buying diesel cars GM will
stop making them. But the feedback is so crude and so long term that
it has little effect.  But the programmable company has much finer
grained touch points and is more attuned to them. More ML means even
more attundedness</p>
<p>So programmable company has all of its activities and its decision
points in code (migration to infrastructure as code) and these nodes
are programmable by internal and external actions.  This assumes more
democracy in the internal decisions (explicitly excluding people is
harder. See the linux hierarchy ? Open discussion, Chinese parliament)</p>
<p>With more activity automated we will see both more effi envy and more
problems - serverless world is where companies have to rebuild their
factories to accommodate software, the grain of the internet</p>
<p>Amazon had to solve these internally and basically released it.</p>
<p>Putting everything into code is the only way forward - from routing to
deliveries to accounts the whole skeleton of companies will need to be
as defined by code as an AWS web server.</p>
<p>We are going to redesign that much</p>
<p>Architecture paradox But this leads to the architecture paradox - by
having a robot do the building there is a lot more upfront work
fromthe architect (coding)</p>
<p>Productivity conjecture
- we are missing the re-arrangement of work - that software literacy may be</p>
<p>I reject utterly that now that every freaking adult on the planet can
communicate with every other that we are not seeing productivity gains
(mobile phone choosing best market for produce)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity
gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is
a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where
every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters
deeply</li>
</ul>
<p>What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification</p>
<p>We are missing the dynamo.</p>
<p>Politics and software</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source - oss4gov manifesto</p>
<p>I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don&#8217;t scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers)</li>
<li>most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company</li>
</ul>
<p>A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it&#8217;s a rubbish decision) so we record</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what was decided</li>
<li>why it was decided</li>
<li>how to judge its success</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it&#8217;s supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company&#8217;s defining code, do that</p>

<h3>A point about Company Size<a class="headerlink" href="#a-point-about-company-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OK, this is meandering a bit but, company size matters. A mid-20C
econmist named Roald Coase had a great theory of the firm - basically
wondering why a firm would have say, an internal depratmetn for, I
dunno, say, market research, when it could go to the outside markte
and buy it in.  Why hire employees basically.  And the answer is its
easier to tell an employee what to do, and then change your mind as
circumstances change, than it is to find, source, and contract for
similar in open market.</p>

<h3>A point about Software Literacy<a class="headerlink" href="#a-point-about-software-literacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Software Literacy is an important concept - it is hard for us to
recongise how literacy has shaped us and our society. Look at road
signs. And it is hard to recognise how much software literacy will
change companies, socieites and opportunities.  This is the
underlying message of &#8220;Software is eating the world&#8221; - we have made
a world that only works because everyone in it can read and write.
We are making a new world, where everyone will be expected to code.</li>
<li>Software is subject to politics, but the importance of software is
leaving development of softre to be driven by people who do not
&#8220;understand&#8221; software (see literacy), and it is also leading to
substandard software being allowed.  Regulation and
professinalisation is likely to affect that.</li>
<li>Almost all software development is about exploring.  And two things
we can say about exploration - you never know how long it is going
to take and it often is risky.  Guess what the vast majority of
project planning and management try and do They demand time
estimates and plan other items around that, and they do not schedule
resources to mitigate risk.  In my experience, software takes as
long as it takes.  All the running around and shouting, the pressure
and the politics are just ways of selling the inevitable time /
money / scope trade offs.</li>

<p>The office building metahpr is a good one because it also includes a
clear idea of just how much is ocvered in software build chains these
days - from Steel girders and foundations to Glass UIs and bathroom
and waste services in conduits no one sees, to building security and

<div class="section" id="technical-architecture">
<h3>Technical Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are lot of &#8220;Technical Architects&#8221; around these days.  (One of
the problems with not having a software profession the same way we do
in actual architecture is its hard to stop people calling themselves a
Technical Architect. (I mean, just look at <em>my</em> business card ...)</p>
<p>A stereotype of TAs is of isolated geniuses (at least they hope to
give that impression) announcing the correct way to build software to
a large team or organisation.</p>
<p>The problem is that if no-one is following yourq architectureal rules,
then you arent an architect.  Architecture is a human function,
persuading others that your way is better.  SOmetimes, we <em>enforce</em>
that - through Software Governance (an important idea we will return
to) In the same way that an Architects design for a building is
followed by the builders, or a City Planners rules for a City are
followed by all agents involved.</p>
<p>With a metaphor of building cities, we can see why the idea of Architecture is
an attractive one, but it is really at the scale of the biggest software houses
in the world (Major Banks and financial instituions) that you can see the incredilbe
value of ... City Planning.  We shall call this Software Governance.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="a-point-about-software-governance">
<h2>A point about Software Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#a-point-about-software-governance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There is a software rule of thumb - that code-bases pass through
&#8216;complexity horizons&#8217; every couple of orders of magnitude. That is a
project that was easy to manage at 1,000 LOC cannot be maintained with
the same approach when its a 10,000 or 100,000 LOC cadebase.</p>
<p>Pieter Levels is a entrpreneur and coder, who found a certain
noteriety in 2017 by announcing that he was making sales of over
$2,000 a day, using a single php file with 4000 LOC, with no
frameworks and libraries.  The Twitter-sphere exploded, quite
amusingly, by criticising his coding approach and insisting he needed
some architecture and frameworks.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<div>&#8220;What about the frameworks. Think of the frameworks&#8221;</div></blockquote>
<p>Pieter seems to be doing fine his way, but yes, at some point the &#8216;one
guy opens up one file&#8217; approach is of course going to fail as
complexity rises.  But managing it with the latest technical framework is
not the right answer - a technical framework is one response to the problem
of increasing complexity, one means of <em>governing</em> the codebase.</p>
<p>How we manage that is <em>software governance</em>.  The goal of software
governance is to raise the floor everywhere.</p>
<p>We can write code, we can write code that gets us to a basic level of
feature complete-ness.  And then the next fire alarm arrives, the next
email from the boss, and ... the polish disappears, the extra bit of
effort to make something long term useful just does not get done.</p>
<p>But that extra piece of effort can pay dividends just for one
developer.  For a team or a whole community, the dividends are
endless, just by raising the floor of quality.</p>
<p>In <cite>todo-inator</cite> I have a concept of self-rating each module or
function with a modern form of P.G. Wodehouse&#8217;s re-writing of
chapters.  This simple mark:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pgw</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">**</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While this is a subjective measure from the developer, it is a guide
to where improvements can be made.  And importantly resides in the
codebase.</p>
<p>Other measures of code quality can be autoated and should be part of
every commit cycle.</p>

<p>The goal here is not best practise, but good enough practise that can
scale enough for you not to panic while replacing it.
Our golden goal is to keep things simple.</p>
<p>Simple breaks in simple ways, simple is simple to extend and improve.</p>
<p>Its not that simple is <em>easy</em> - often it is the opposite of easy, or quick.</p>
<p>But simple wins out over time. Simple gives great ROI.</p>

<h2>Continuous Integration (CI)<a class="headerlink" href="#continuous-integration-ci" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<div>Re-create your company from scratch, every single day.</div></blockquote>
<p>Continuous Integration / Delivery is probably the biggest boon to developer produtivity
since the rise of memory managed languages in the 90&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Languages like C expected the developer to write code that assigned a
certain amount of memory for a certain data structure - which meant at
the point of writing your code, you had to know <em>how big the data was
going to be, in say two years time</em>.</p>
<p>People would get this wrong.  The biggest security risk for many years
was your program accepting a piece of data larger than expected and
simply overwriting its own memory.  With luck your program just
crashed.  Otherwise the hacker was very good, and the piece of data
sent just put their evil code on top of the stack ready to be run.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the business logic we grind out does not need to worry about
such things.  Instead we have the fun of not being entirely sure if
the version of the code we think of is going to run on the server with
the code we think of, using the password we meant and thats if no one
else changed anything.</p>

<p>Software Governance as a force multiplier implies a number of things
One is that each individual contributor should have the same minimal
set of skills, and perform those common skills in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>An obvious example might be making good source code commits, and so there
would need to be an internal &#8220;standard&#8221; for commits.</p>
<p>This of course implies ... training. Training your staff to be better
at their jobs, something that the commitment-less culture these days
seems to mitigate against.  Things will change - our &#8220;principle&#8221; of a
change to Roald Coase&#8217;s equilibrium point means smaller companies, and
greater need to standard interfaces and so more need to train your
people to do it the right way.</p>

<p>Basically we cannot do it.  So why do people ask for estimates? They
dont want estimates - they want evenly spaced landmarks. They want
confidence that progress is being made.</p>
<p>It if ain&#8217;t got a ticket dont work on it If it ain&#8217;t possible to
rollup tickets you dont know where you are going A backlog out of
context is just a horror There is nothing wrong with top-down design

<p>How companies need to reactively plan, with exception / assert monitoring.
How this replaces &#8220;managment judgement&#8221; with clear budgeting.?</p>
<p>** Project Management
The Chairman&#8217;s tricky Question
==============================</p>
<p>Some time ago I was asked by the Chairman of the Board what one thing
he could do to make sure all these damn software projects were under
control.</p>
<p>What he meant by under-control, was <em>on-time</em> and <em>as expected</em>. Which
is not what I meant.</p>
<p>So I had two answers.   One was under control from a development perspective.
This is pretty simple and  boils  down to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Require <em>every</em> project to automatically deploy to at least a prod-parallel
environment, <em>every</em> day, their most recent approved, tested code
and post their test results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These seemed radical, but achievable.  A lot of the <em>technical</em> side
of this Dev Manual is focused on achieving this.</p>
<p>But the <em>real</em> point was about <em>on-time</em> and <em>as expected</em>.  And that
is where I gave an answer he did not like.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stop having deadlines.  That way nothing is late.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes.  You can see why it was not a popular suggestion.</p>
<p>We will expand on that, but I am going to stick to it.  I hate
deadlines.  They infect everything with panic and poor quality.  And
the deadlines are almost always derived from poor information about
reality, and where the deadline should be, and rarely if ever updated,
as if reality and poor estimation are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Its much better to have regular, reality-grounded views on where one
really is, and alter plans based on that.  Automatically.</p>
<p>Deadlines sometimes help. Mostly they do not.</p>
<p>If it ain&#8217;t ready, setting the deadline to today won&#8217;t make it ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;out of the tar pit&#8221; marks/moseley - over simplified it says complexity is the problem in software, and there are two types of complexity - state and control.</p>
<p>A third type is information failures or shooting ourselves in the foot.</p>
<p>There are then three fixes for the world</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>functional programming for managing state (immutable data)</li>
<li>but data does chnage - so how to handle it? datomic?? bi or tri temporality</li>
<li>functional reactive programming and dag - and what about SAC</li>
</ul>
<p>apache spark is fundamentally one of these. which will win?? hard to say but my money is one language-data tie ups (erlang mnesia, clojure datomic)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/">https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.janestreet.com/breaking-down-frp/">https://blog.janestreet.com/breaking-down-frp/</a></p>
<p>Basically don&#8217;t waste time on recomputing
Which is why Vitrual don can be a dag</p>
<p>Why graphs matter. And who cares</p>
<p>Scope and coverage</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NoSQL and scale and distribution versus consistency</li>
<li>rise of functional languages</li>
<li>the declarative language we all know - SQL</li>
<li>datomic and clojure</li>
<li>out of the tar pit (mosley and marks) - two problems are state and control - functional solves some of state but state of data changes.  how to handle changing data ?</li>
<li>bitemproarilty and tritemoorality - date we wrote it down, date fact was true, date we are querying about.</li>
<li>Information management</li>
<li>systems analysis</li>
<li>domain analysis</li>
<li>leave me alone i am thinking</li>
<li>stop micro managing</li>
<li>no you cannot have an estimate only a direction.  deadline? maybe. try a business solution</li>
<li>do it smaller first</li>
<li>mission and process wins more often</li>
<li>ownership of small area wins as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a incident response book</p>
<p>Have a run book
- basic principle is automate the shit out of it</p>

<tr><td class="label">[8]</td><td>The linked essay is by Eric S Raymond and is almost two
decades old, and lays out an important philosophical difference
between how open source software gets developed (in a mad press of new
things being tried out) and how cathedrals are built.  The cathedral
builders have tried to learn from the bazaar, and concepts like Agile
are helping (a bit) but building software in our modern day
institutions is still frustrating.  As software eats the world, it
will find politics and push back.</td></tr>
