<p>THere must be acoase minimum - how is that changing.</p>
<p>Why are companies the size and structure they are. why are some
companies more successful than others, seemingly able to take on more
challenges at faster speed?</p>
<p>these questions are the reason bookshops groan under the weight of hardback business books trying to sell the answers, but they also are deeply important questions for humans globally - the organisation, be it commercial company, government department or city hall is the umbrella of protection for almost all humans alive today - for legal protection, income and environment</p>
<p>Solow and productivity.
Productivty praradox, iphone and electrification of factories</p>
<p>COase and theory of firm
size of firms -&gt; BAML vs google.</p>
<p>New firm</p>
<p>Programmable company:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">the entirity of business is in code. Not in the middle management,
not in &#8220;how we do things&#8221;</p>
<p>the approval workflow system is an example of how good but unavailable idea holds things back dramatically. scalability is not just size but speed as well</p>
<p>designing your processes for scale matters too</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see Apple Run book / operations managemet as the earlu step in this world
But a completely what-if, flexible company will be anle to turn on a dime.</p>
<p>But this will come at costs - humans dont do well and need ther sort of explanation and mission and feed into decision making</p>
<p>Imagine everyone having their own engaged model of the company (ciuntry) and arging which is best format.  May never decide? or may just go with flow?</p>

Excellent take on coase minimum</p>
<p>So in modern world the process is thenthings - a single slip up causes horro - something a s project mange I know too well.  Approvals ...</p>
<p>And so what is needed is solutions to this - continuous integration is tried - but this is fixing things after they gone wrong - just really quickly after they go wrong</p>
<p>Apples vaunted process is to model the process correctly first</p>
<p>And this is my argument for the new company - the programmable company is one where all the interactions are programmed and viable in pre-production allowing choice, optimisationand modelling</p>

<h2>Why companies are not really command and control<a class="headerlink" href="#why-companies-are-not-really-command-and-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Politics gets in the way.  At the point at which internal polirics (conpettion over resources)
starts haveing serious consequesnces is my view ofr the coase minimum</p>
<p>An interesting blog by google about manifesto</p>
<p>Idea was as got further on in career stopped doing the coding and
started doing the &#8220;what needs to be done and how&#8221; stuff</p>
<p>But this is precisely what a market is good at.</p>
<p>Looking at my experience of large companies an awful lot of management
(risk and project) is just competing with other people to be first to
look viable and have a following - thisnis ridiculous Ina centrally
planned economy of a company - you may as well do it properly and have
a market place (tournament style promotions etc) especially as there
is less likelihood of Values conflicts</p>
<p>Of course not everyone Is an entrepreneur- everyone more likely to be
of their basic income is protected.</p>
<p>Also why airbucks.io is an example of project that works in
marketplace but notninside company</p>
