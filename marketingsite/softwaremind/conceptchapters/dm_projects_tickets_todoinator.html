<h1>Ask a Software Engineer to design Project Management<a class="headerlink" href="#ask-a-software-engineer-to-design-project-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>&lt;Name&gt;, an influential Googler who helped popularise the idea of
Software Reliability Engineer (SRE) said &#8220;SRE is what you get when you ask a
developer to design an Operations process.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, this entire book can be boiled down to &#8220;Software Literate companies is what you get when you ask a developer to design a company&#8221;.</p>
<p>But lets just look at one (important) aspect of a company - <em>Project
Management</em>.  Fundamentally, work inside a company can be divided into
two parts - <em>running the company</em> and <em>changing (improving?) the
company</em>.</p>
<p>Running the company is just the day-to-day
business-as-usual processes.  Opening up the store, stocking the
shelves etc.  (and yes, very amenable to automation).</p>
<p>Changing the company is usually harder.  It is a search process usually, looking for product-market fit for early stage companies, or later stage companies loking for efficencies etc.</p>
<p>And CHanging the company is almost always coralled into <em>projects</em>.  As such automating project management will be very very helpful.</p>
<p>And as we are designgin a softweare literate company, we dhall desing a compny that is mostly automated, and driven by software - and as such changing the software means changing the company.</p>
<p>Lets repeat that - changing the codebase, means changing a company. And if changing the codebase is now project management, then project management should flow <em>from</em> gthe codebase.</p>

<h2>Software Literate Project Management.<a class="headerlink" href="#software-literate-project-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am embarrassingly bad at traditional Project management.
Co-ordination, keeping an eye on the most important parts.  Basically
I assume that if i know something, then everyone else knows it too.
So there would be no point in telling other people about
it. Co-ordinating. for example.  Also my timekeeping sucks which tends
to piss everyone off eventually. (Such as the woman I left waiting at
the Cinema so long, the film actually finished before I got
there. There wasn&#8217;t a second date.  Not sure why I am sharing, but you
get the idea. Manual project management is a skill I really want to
automate away.)</p>
<p>So what can a codebase do that is <em>better</em> than manual project managers?
Better than teams of &#8220;change specialists&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, lets start with lying.  People lie. Everyone lies. If your
husband asks if this sweater makes him look fat round the middle, you
say &#8220;no darling&#8221;.  If your boss&#8217; boss asks if the project is going to
be ready on time, you are <em>optimistic</em>.  You don&#8217;t for example,
recommend a regieme of salads, beans and cutting out the chocolate
biscuits while running 2 miles a day.  You dont say the code base is
crap, the test coverage laughable and the specifications so vague we
still dont know what the goal is.</p>
<p>No, you lie. So your boss thinks its ok. And meerily everyone trundles along
kind of hoping everything will work out all right.</p>
<p>Whcih brings us to project management and risk management</p>
<p>Which brings us to Backlogs and True State of project</p>
<p>WHich brings us to tests, and velocity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>everybody lies</li>
<li>Capex and Opex, hidden Capex, slow code movement, spikes and inches.</li>
<li>Software Option pricing</li>
<li>Capturng cost data. Infrastructure as code.</li>
<li>ticketing, scrum and agile, co-ordination, risk management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone hates agile

<ul class="simple">
<li>anecdotally loads of time money thrown away as people decide to rewrite or chnage minds</li>
<li>this will be more carefully managed if it was clear from capex how much this costs</li>
