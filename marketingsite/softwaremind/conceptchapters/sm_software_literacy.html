<h1>Software Literacy<a class="headerlink" href="#software-literacy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>I&#8217;m standing in a cavernous room underneath a bustling, noisy pub in
London&#8217;s Covent Garden.  It was a fine Summers day and the evening is
sharply cooking.</p>
<p>I look around at the 90-odd developers, graduates and entrepreneurs in
the room, and, as I have been persuaded to sponsor this meeting, now
all I have to do is give a quick speech.</p>
<p>I never quite know what to do for these sort of speeches - so I decide
to give a history lesson. Yes. A history lesson. Gripping stuff, some
were even rolling their eyes in excitement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good one though. You see, in 1454, Johannes Gutenberg printed
the first of his Bibles using movable type - and ushered in a new era
of literacy and communication. Printing books was now orders of
magnitude cheaper, and there was an explosion of publishing. The
number of published books leapt from an estimated 30,000 books <em>in all
of Europe in 1450</em> to 12 million books by 1500.  Think about that. A
decent sized library today, in many large towns in England will have
30,000 books.  More than were in the whole of Europe before the
printing press. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Within a generation literacy in Western Europe had leapt from under 2%
to well over 20% - and it changed everything. Martin Luther was able
to nail a piece of paper to a church door and expect most members of
the middle-class congregation to simply read it, not have it read to
them by clergy. Books on mathematics and navigation enabled the
training of middle-class merchantmen who would then dare, only 40
years later, to cross the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Literacy en mass changed the course of human history and gave a tiny
corner EurAsia some huge advantages the effects of which are only just
wearing off five centuries later.</p>
<p>Before people wandered off to the bar I decided to let them know why
they were getting my best Simon Scharma impression.</p>
<p>Because, in my view, and remember they were eating my sausage rolls,
so that counts, in my view we are entering the age of a new form of
literacy - <em>software literacy.</em></p>
<p>Even in the 15th century, nations, companies and guilds and churches
competed, and ran international concerns. But somewhere between
Gutenberg&#8217;s Bible and Luther&#8217;s 95 Theses these companies changed. Not
with business process reengineering, or total quality circles - but
changed like leaving the water and walking on land changed. I have no
idea how to quantify the advantages a company whose staff can all read
and write will have over a company whose staff are illiterate. It&#8217;s
not one of lower labour cost, or better marketing, it&#8217;s something
else...Deep in our bones we <em>know</em> that literacy changes everything.
Its so built into us and into everyone we know that we cannot imagine
a world where we cannot read or write.</p>
<p>Anyway, you, like the poor people wanting to get to the bar, can see
where I am taking this. The ability to marshall knowledge, to code and
compile and compute, the natural inclination to arrange the world so
it can be iterated over, the ability to turn a business from a
medieval scriptorium into an operating system is software literacy.</p>
<p>The final shape of a software literate company is probably unguessable
to us, in the same way that an airports departures board was
unguessable to Pope Pius II, or that a major newspaper run by
illiterate editors will look and work nothing like the Washington
Post. But we can be sure they are coming. And we can make sensible
predictions about what they will and won&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>And so, as the Meetup wanders back to the bar slightly shocked, we
wander back to our theme.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-software-literate-company-and-the-programmable-company">
<h2>The software literate company, and the programmable company<a class="headerlink" href="#the-software-literate-company-and-the-programmable-company" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Software literacy for a company does not mean that it just hires a lot
of programmers, and calls the job done.  Thats been happening for a
long time and yet few companies manage to evolve.  I am hoping to
describe in this book a vision of a company <em>that does not exist yet</em>.
A truly literate company, in a world of other softwre literate
companies.  We cannot know for sure the shape such companies will
take - they will jostle and change in a complex dance of evolution,
but we can look at both positive and negative data we have today - how
companies have failed to act in a sane / literate manner, and how some
fundamentals of software literacy are shining thorugh and will be
unavoidable in the future.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">When I speak of a literate company, please keep this film in mind.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&#8216;All the President&#8217;s Men&#8217; is one of my favourite films, engrossing and
suspenseful.  And it also portrays life in a deeply literate company.</p>
<p>I will take a leap and argue that the Washington Post under Ben
Bradlee was the epitome of a (non-software) literate company.  It had
well trained professionals, clear ethical standards, clear business
processes and clear processes for ensuring that its literate output
met their standards. Editors and copy-sub-editors and so on.  Oh, and
cashflow. That helped a lot.</p>
<p>I suggest that even companies like tech-behemoth Google are not really
software literate ... yet. But the clues are there. In the excellent
SRE book (link) author (link) the &#8220;founder&#8221; of SRE in Google, defines
SRE as &#8220;SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design
an operations team&#8221;.  As we go forward we shall find the software
literate companies are what happens when software engineers design
(found, run, populate and evolve) companies.  The flush of unicorns
today in Silicon Valley are nearly software literate - the effort of
founding a company is so huge that it&#8217;s hard to believe that what
results is what a software engineer would design. Things get missed.
But each generation of companies will steal from previous until the
majority of a company is what would be designed.</p>
<p>Does it make a difference - well let&#8217;s compare the old &#8220;knowledge
company&#8221; and the new. In 2012 <cite>Google</cite> had a revenue of $50bn and a
workforce of 40,000 - whereas the finance house <cite>Barclays
International</cite> also had a revenue of $50bn, but a far larger workforce
of 120,000.  Fast-forward to 2016 and <cite>Google</cite> has grown to $89bn and
70,000 people.  In the same year of 2016, <cite>Bank Of America</cite> posted
revenues of $89bn, and a workforce of over 200,000 people.  There are
many caveats comparing these numbers, but all the firms involved are
resolutely &#8220;knowledge-based&#8221; - the core processes of the firms do not
involve smelting iron ore or manufacturing cars.  And yet <cite>Google</cite>
carries 2/3 less humans for same revenue at each stage.  One of them
has used software in a markedly different manner.</p>
<p>One of them has become more <em>software literate</em>.</p>

<h2>Just what is a programmable company?<a class="headerlink" href="#just-what-is-a-programmable-company" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Companies just reflect what is the organisational capability of a
group of humans.  How do we control a group of us to act as (more or
less) as one.  WHere and how does a group action stop looking like a
single agency and more like a market, a flock.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question.</p>
<p>My optimism says huma markets - flocks - make it feasible we all work together.</p>

</div>
<p>My conjecture is that we are hitting a limit on what tracking company
processes through accounting can do to limit wasteful (coase)
growth. That by forcing more reproducible processes into</p>
<p>And this is my definition of a programmable company - where all
processes are visible in the virtual world</p>
<p>The brilliant mid-twentieth century Economist <cite>Roald Coase</cite> gave us a
fascinating way to model why companies and organisations are the size
they are - a Theory of the Firm.  We shall dive deeper into this later
on but as more and more processes become visible in the virtual, as we
practise &#8216;topless computing&#8217;, then we shall see dramatic shifts in the
size and shape of our organisations.</p>
<p>I think there is another interesting way to look at Coase firm size -
its to do with the cost of <em>trusting data</em>.  If data is published
internally, or from a <em>trusted third party</em> (lets say Reuters) there
is a limited amount of double checking needed.  Rumour is aproblem in
all companies, but Fake News is not. But with smaller and smaller
companies, the cost of finding and <em>trusting</em> data increases.</p>
<p>The fight against fake news is going to be a long defining one in
years to come.  The most obvious way is simply to revert back to the
old saw &#8220;You can have your own opnion, but not your own facts&#8221;. The
KGB lead approach to destroying this is to put so many fake facts, so
much chaff, that people just reinforce their own biases.  SOme method to
validate real geniuine facts against fake facts is within reach.
We can see how cameras could sign images, how articles published could be
cryptographically signed and stored, how facts marked up in the text.</p>
<p>ANd so how news aggregators (sorry advertising companies) like Google and Facebook
could use that to mark fake news as such.</p>
<p>SOme method to validate inferences from a <em>selection</em> of facts.  Well.
Thats harder. Hell, Human Politics might be defined as that problem.</p>
<p>As such the current privacy, GDPR world is not merely a lefy liberal
problem. It is a major factor in form size, market efficency and the
underlying fundamentals of</p>
<p>How do I know - well, as a software literate person, its just obvious.</p>
<p>We are already seeing calls for the software industry to regulate
itself, on privacy, on deals with repressive regiemes.  The answer is
not as simple as coders all being nice people.  But society needs to
regulate and also accept change.  We shall see that in section 2.</p>
<p>But companies, governments and organisations of every stripe, will need to adapt
to a new set of technologies that have a grain, a direction of travel, ... a tidal force.
Those techologies are here now, and our old organisational structures are no longer
sufficent.</p>
<p>Lets look at it this way - Facebook, if it took all 1.5 BILLION users
and moved to a new land mass would be the worlds largest
country. Ever.</p>
<p>And it would be the least democratic. Ever. A one man dictatorship. No
law courts, no police, no constitution.  Nada.  And yet every Facebook
app-using citizen would have more daily contact (what 3 hours a day?)
with its &#8220;government&#8221; than they ever had with their proper governments.</p>
<p>Each day we see some new controversy, YouTube failing to police its
comments section against paedophiles, (find more examples).  This is not because
Facebook is inherently evil, but because we are moving our lives online - and
<em>some</em> people moving online <em>are</em> inherently evil. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>So companies, governments, organisations, the structures we all spend
so much of our lives working within, need to change to get the best
out of the new technologial opportunity we face.</p>
<p>Because it could be a golden future for humanity.  Honest.</p>

<h3>From literacy to programmability<a class="headerlink" href="#from-literacy-to-programmability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<div>&#8220;Writing is nature’s way of showing us how sloppy our thinking is.&#8221;
Leslie Lamport</div></blockquote>
<p>I very happily recounted my &#8220;Literacy started with the printing press,
software literacy starts with the Internet&#8221; meme in the last chapter.
I was rather proud of my little self, right up until I attended
<cite>Sprint 16</cite> the UK Government&#8217;s annual conference on tech and software
and government.  And the Minister for the Cabinet Office stood up and
gave a keynote that was basically the speech I gave so many years
prior in a London pub basement.</p>
<p>Nothing stops you feeling smug like national politicians spouting the
same ideas as you.</p>
<p>But the thing is, we are both right.  Although his suit was better.</p>
<p>The first mass-literacy revolution ran roughly in parallel with the
Commercial and Industrial Revolutions in Europe.  But apart from the
usual things we associate with literacy, things like sharing ideas
widely, democratic access to knowledge and so on, the one that is
often <em>missed</em> is that ideas have to be much more precisely expressed
when you write them down.  If you go around making speeches, each
person can walk off with different ideas as to what you said but
writing it down means it is waaay harder to mistake what you meant.</p>
<p>WIth software this applies to the n&#8217;th degree. There is no longer any
forgiving human mind in the way of your writing to work out what you
really meant. Software is unforgiving. The compiler will do what you
tell it.  And this means we shall have to write down what we really
mean.</p>
<p>This is going to be a problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>self driving car issue</li>
<li>access to agorithms</li>
<li>gorillas AI</li>
</ul>
<p>Some computer vision AI software failed to see black women as human
faces - accurately reflecting the cultural make up of the AI
laboratory it sprang from.  And we shall have to solve the multiutude
of robotic actions in the real world that were previosuly left to
chance.  See the chapter on self-driving cars for example.</p>
<p>So software literacty is not just a nice fluffy teach the world to
code idea.  It is going to be a fundamental questioning of every
aspect of our society and assumptions.  And we will need much much
better at resolving those conflicts - large scale democratic politics
does not seem to be good at this. Although, as per Churchill, it is a
<em>lot</em> better than all the others.</p>
<p>I do not see this as some portent of doom. More that we are <em>already</em>
in a world too sophisticated for any one mind to understand.  We rely
utterly on the expertese, and indeed munificence of others.  Its just
that the procedures for all these are still hidden and opaque. Partly
because it is commercailly beneficial, but the vast majority of the
time it is just the processes have not been made into software, and so
are not accessible.</p>
<p>Some companies are more software literate than others. It is hard to
define this but we can see some outlines in the fog.  They are
basically around a quote from Googler &lt;name&gt;</p>

<div class="section" id="knight-capital">
<h2>Knight Capital<a class="headerlink" href="#knight-capital" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Knight Capital should have been software literate.  It was a new
company, built to operate in the high-frequency trading world of US
equities, and had invested heavily in programmers and computers</p>
<p>Their business model was <em>market making</em> - buying shares from someone
who wanted to sell, waiting a bit, and selling them to someone who
wanted to buy. Market making is a valued part of all exchanges, and
way back, when the Exchange gave a priviledged few the right to be
market makers (for a fee of course) it was a very profitable exercise.
However as new market makers were granted access, such as Knight
Capital, the profits dropped (good for buyers and sellers, such as our
pension funds) and the competition sped up - slow market makers did
not get to trade with anyone.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital released a new version of their
software. And did so in a partly-manual manner.  Those words, &#8216;not
automated&#8217; make those who are software literate shudder.  Imagine
having a book as a loose sheaf of papers, unbound.  You know its just
missing something.  Surely things will eventually get all muddled up.
And sure enough, at Knight Capital, they had left an old, debug
version of the code on one of their servers. Which now merrily started
placing <em>test</em> orders onto the <em>real</em> market.</p>
<p>Test orders, such as Buy high and Sell at a loss, and repeat 10,000
times in a few fractions of a second.</p>
<p>Knight Capital tried to turn off their mistakes, but 45 minutes later
(an eternity in HFT) they had mistakenly executed 4 million orders for
100+ stocks, and lost 440 million dollars, effectively bankrupting the
company.  Other players in the market had of course realised something
was wrong, and initially expected the orders to be turned off within
seconds. When it was not, they merrily took the winning side on all
Knight Capitals traded and pocketed the cash. No point turning down
free money is there?</p>
<p>Knight Capital&#8217;s process of getting software that had been written
correctly out and into the hands of users (ie the equivalent of
publishing) was broken.  A newspaper that could write brilliant
articles but struggled with the whole delivering bundles to street
vendors would not last long.</p>
<p>In software, this publishing is called a release, but its as vital as
the process of publishing and delivering paper was to the Post.
Companies I have worked in have had ranges of automated releases done
a few times a day, or manually a few times a year.  Guess who felt
more ... literate.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Knight Capital paid the full price for their
failure to control their literacy. However, this market imposed
discipline, which is societally a Good Thing, does not apply equally.
Goldman Sachs did a similar thing in 2016, sending broken orders.
Then instead of being forced to pay the price for their mistake, they
simply agreed with the exchange that those orders <em>did not count</em>,
reverted the changes and did not pay a billion for their own
education.</p>
<p>Thats simply wrong.  Remeber our nice fluffy liberal &#8220;everyone is
equal&#8221; values. That should apply to everyone.</p>

<div class="section" id="office-of-personnel-management">
<h2>Office Of Personnel Management<a class="headerlink" href="#office-of-personnel-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In June 2015, the US government agency &#8220;Office of Personnel
Management&#8221; announced it had suffered a data breach.  Starting in
March 2014, external hackers had breached the firewalls around the
agency and were able to access the personnel records of millions of
current and former government workers.  The agency collected many
things, like pay records, but also, held background checks on
employees who needed higher levels of security clearance - in short
they had the records that said you used to be a drug addict or
depressed. All the stuff they want to know about you in case it is
used to balckmail you.</p>
<p>This was it seems all stored on mainframes running COBOL.  And the
thing about storing data is that you must at minimum, encrypt it at
rest on disk.  This is like, using ink or folders or filing
cabinets. Its something you don&#8217;t even think about.  Not for stuff
that foreign governments can use to blackmail your Embassy staff with.</p>
<p>So lets get this clear.  Vital security information and pay records,
stored unencrypted on mainframes that are so old they cannot spell
encryption, and then the Chinese hackers get in.</p>
<p>This breach, discovered seemingly by accident when a computer
forensics firm was asked to preapre a demo, is not something solvable
by replacing credit cards.  It is probably America&#8217;s deepest national
security problem for the next few decades.  Well, one of them.</p>
<p>This is a defining moment in software professionalism.  The right move
for a professional and so the right move for a software literate
organisation, was to shutdown the impossible-to-secure mainframes and
announce a budget request and a migration plan.</p>
<p>Things like intrusion detection programs would have been good, but
thats just &#8220;normal best practise&#8221; not &#8220;professional ethics&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, why did the woman at the top (not likely a malicious actor) why
did she not take this action? Because of the degree of obfuscation?
Possibly. But the one thing that leaps out of OPM is the inabiliy to
enmcrypt on COBOL mainframes.</p>
<p>Perhasp Everything else is justifiable in the hindsight race.  But
when you simply cannot do the job ethics dictates you dont pretend and
carry on.</p>
<p>OPM shows us that one defining quality of software literacy will be
professional ethics. to quote Spiderman, &#8220;with great power comes great
responsibility&#8221;.  For the next generation at least, software literacy
will be unevenly spread throughout the world.  And the importance of
software to the world at large is so great that we should ensure those
who wield that importance are not just expected to be trustworthy, but
are monitored by their peers.</p>
<p>Professional Ethics still matters</p>

<p>As part of Barack Obama&#8217;s healthcare reforms (back pre-Trump, if you
can rememebr that far back) a government agency was tasked with
setting up a online exchange that would allow hundreds of millions of
Americans to search for and find the most suitable of the new
insurance contracts that were available.  The project was handled in
the usual manner, and as is usual for large software projects it
failed to achieve its goals.  THis was hugely embarrasing and
<em>actually meant a large scale political initiative was at risk because
software it depended on was badly written</em>. (THis in itself is a
seismic moment.)</p>
<p>So the while mess was put in the lap of one of the new Breed of
GOvernment Best-practise Digital Agency, who proceeded to rescue the
mess, using best practise appraches. (it was not an unalloyed success,
but it worked).  Famously the attitude used was boiled down to a quote
from a frustrated DevOps engineer, who during a fraught and well
populated project meeting asked &#8220;If I cannot deploy New Relic (a
systems monitoring system) I&#8217;m gonna punch somebody&#8221;.</p>
<p>WHilst violence in the workplace is obbiously forbidden, the teams it
seems divided along the lines of people who thought it was obvious to
use these new tools, and thus obvvious that someone banned from using
them should get driven to rage, and those who thought it was obvious
to follow the old, way.</p>
<p>THis dividing line is what i think of as the software literate line.
The point at which one thinks &#8220;WTF?&#8221; when looking at processes or

company or society that, for example, has a legion of clergymen, who
stand up in chilly expensive cathedrals, and read out political
declarations.  And say, &#8220;Why not just print them and nail them to the
church door so people can just read it themselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>That is the dividing line.  That is the sort of change to society

<h2>The programmable company<a class="headerlink" href="#the-programmable-company" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One theme I shall return to is the idea that companies and
organisations are simply means to organise humans - and that has lower
cost and friction than it used to with software intermediation.</p>
<p>To put it simply, almost everything that is done in a normal company
now can be automated, and the co-ordination of functions is an email
away.</p>
<p>For almost everything a company or organisation does a second time,
that can be automated or co-ordinated via software.  A company will
become a programmable entity.  Most if not all effort that goes into
todays software projects, goes not into creating new business logic, but into
finding the data, massaging it, guaranteeing it, handling exceptions, and fitting into the rest of the businesses weird ways.</p>
<p>But a programmable company, that has robust exception handling, that has open standards that are easy to fit into, that has trustable data,</p>

<p>None of these are purely technical foul-ups.  Where humans are

<p>It&#8217;s how would an illiterate person run the Washington Post.  Ben
bradlee</p>
<p>Healthcare.gov - one of the team responsible for the clean up of
healthcare.gov tells a story (YouTube). He explains. But mostly he
says they did nothing clever, they invented nothing new. They just ran
best practises (the famous new relic punch).</p>
<p>But why did they run best practises and not others. There are many
explanations, multiple gov contractors, sclerotic practises etc. but
ultimately the people at the top looked at a newspaper that was run as
it would be run by an illiterate and said &#8220;well I can&#8217;t see how else
it should run&#8221;, because they were illiterate too.</p>

<p>So as we know what is wrong, it is useful to dive into why, and what

<p>But let&#8217;s look at ambient computing.

<p>Scenario: I walk from my kitchen to the living room, and the music I had playing dims in kitchen
And starts up in living room speakers.  I say &#8220;house! Something more dinner jazz please, and dim the lights&#8221;</p>
<p>Now to do this I must have computer monitoring me and my voice
It must stream music, electric usage will dip.</p>
<p>How can I defend my privacy?
Do I really care ?
Prevention of annoyance?
My music tastes probably say only a little politically
but what films I watch, what documentaries? Fox News or CNN ?</p>
<p>Social organisation and software
- software as it needs precision highlights a lot

Basically the low hanging fruit of mechanisation has gone.</p>
<p>Productivity as measure of energy used to output</p>
<p>The future is more complex solutions to drive smaller increments in productivity until energy becomes orders magnitude cheaper or our usage orders more sophisticated</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>also remote working and competition across the globe</li>

<p>Privacy:</p>
<p>The biggest issue of our time
The modern day pollution
The issue is who sets the laws
The issue is we must be regulated (murder)
The issue is we shall see Google become a utility in need of regulation - but under whose jurisdiction?</p>
<p>How in Europe do we set this? How in USA? What about China (monitoring all )</p>
<p>Privacy shield - max schremms</p>
<p>Audio visual media services directive - tv regulation. Country of origin country of destination</p>
<p>Unregulated is impossible
Light regulation means skills and information to deal with</p>
<p>The less regulation, the more transparency and individual tools to compensate</p>
<p>My view: it is harmful to insist on country of destination style solutions to regulation as these allow dictatorships to censor</p>
<p>We should have global agreements on base regulation (child pornogrpahy, hate speech etc) and enforce transparency - and it is upto destinations to educate and provide tools to support their choices.</p>

important, why re-creating the existing work is important, why open

and why, we cannot understand everything.</p>
<p>It takes a genius to put all that in 8 words.</p>
<p>So, what can be extracted from eight words.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build from scratch</li>
<li>Open Source keeps re-inventing the wheel</li>
<li>software is evolved</li>
<li>relax.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="build-from-scratch">
<h2>Build from scratch<a class="headerlink" href="#build-from-scratch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of my software development tenets is you should be able to <em>build
your whole systems from scratch</em>.  That is given bare metal hardware,
get up and running, not from a few lucky backups and _dd_ but from
controlled scripted installs.</p>
<p>I have always thought this vital - without being able to (re)create
your systems, how do you know if you can in a disaster, or more
importantly that you can when it is not a disaster.  ITs impossible to
believe that the first time you installed your webserver you got it
perfect, first time, but if you cannot rebuild it with confidence, you
just will put off rebuilding it again and again until it is a mess of
libraries, patches and symlinks that you could never hope to remmeberm
nor worse, simplifiy.  Now expand that to your DNS, file server, your
database.</p>
<p>But being able to run a simple script, and the system is configured,
that makes life so much simpler.  I can read the script and see what it
will do.  I can change it, experiment, confident that I can just rerun
the original and get back to where I started.  And I can run the script
and go do something more interesting.</p>
<p>And no, I do not believe in _dd_, _ghost_ or other image based
methods.  Yes, they are very nice for Virtualisation, but always there
is a flaw - to get to an image, one has to build the original.  If you
build the original by hand, how do you know what steps you took - how
sure can you be? The Sysadmin was very careful?  Was he? Thats nice.
Oh look a new patch is out, and we no longer want to use version 5.2.2
of php and can we put the incompatible library onto only half of the
hosts.  Can you rebuild all of the images to do that, by tomorrow?
Still going to be careful are you?</p>
<p>Build from scripts, from scratch.</p>
<p>And you know what, I finally worked out why I was so insistent on this,
in the face of others desire to take the easy route.  Quite simply because
I did not understand a system till I had wrestled it enough to automate it.</p>
<p>You find out where all the gaps are when you try and automate a system.</p>

<p>I am (re)writing a ER diagramming tool, for about the third time. This time no
funny copyright issues with my employers, I swear.</p>
<p>But there are many ER tools out there. And there are many languages, databases,
games and more.  This does not stop us from writing another, just as
the existence of a Haynes car manual does not stop people from taking their
car engine apart.  We do it because we do not understand, and we want to learn.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is an itch to scratch.  But often the itch is for knowledge,
and the desire to know if we <em>can</em>.  Benefiting the rest of the world is what we
do to share our knowledge.</p>

<p>I am sometimes troubled by comparing myself to some of life&#8217;s winners.  But
looking at Feynman makes those comparisons silly.  A genius that other genius&#8217;
thought a genius, he still tried to understand this strange world we live in,

<p>So, we do what we can.  And move the world on a little bit.  Some more than

Price of gold is fairly stable
==============================</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I do love me a bit of Ancient Rome.  And I love the term Solid - it came from the solidus, a gold coin minted by Constantine 315AD</p>
<p>Domain have done some amateur digging and will try the following: in Neros day 2 denarii would buy a Modius, which was sufficent grain for ten days for one average male (two one pound loaves a day, there is a diet to make wheat intolerant weep)</p>
<p>Now the aureus was replaced by the solidus, but it was about 25 denarii.  So we can say that one gold coin bought you about 100 -120 days worth of basic food.</p>
<p>A kuggerand is about four times the weight of gold as a aureus, and it&#8217;s about £1,000 to buy today. And at £3 per day I could carefully feed myself.  Certainly in bread alone.</p>
<p>So over nearly 2000 years, a gold coin is roughly enough to feed one man for three months.</p>
<p>Fascinating</p>

<h1>What a foul up<a class="headerlink" href="#what-a-foul-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>So, I made a dick move yesterday. I misunderstood someone&#8217;s comment (or I misunderstood their intention) and ... well &#64;dang accused me of racewar and something about stone tablets and science.</p>
<p>I was of course outraged and reacted. Then a minute later I took a deep breath and reacted better.</p>
<p>We all value our reputation and having a judgement so clearly divergent from my own self perception has caused some internal reflection.</p>
<p>You see, there is an old joke about the definition of a liberal - a conservative who just got arrested.</p>
<p>Looking at my self in the mirror, I still see a sensible well balanced person, with strong liberal tendencies (who has worked at the UK version of ACLU, organised anti-intimidation watchdogs at voting booths in racially charge elections in London, and so on - things which while true when repeated here they still sound hollowly like &#8220;some of my best friends are&#8221;)</p>
<p>I am sure dang and the other hard working moderators see a lot of crap in their job.  I am of course <em>certain</em> that that was not what I meant - who me?</p>
<p>Except that one thing middle age teaches you is that, quite often, it is you.</p>
<p>So yes, when someone arrives with a Vote Trump T shirt they probably do not find HN an easy place to discuss things in the terms they usually use.  And they will I am sure always protest &#8220;but it was not me, but what I said was perfectly sensible debate / free speech, how dare you accuse me like that, gosh you should treat people better around here, I am off to Breightbart&#8221;</p>
<p>But just like the recently arrested conservative I want to say just that (well not the breightbart bit obviously, but I certainly felt ill-used. Especially the bit about &#8220;other breaches of the guidelines in my previous history&#8221;. Yeah gulp. I have asked for a list - in my case because I want to analyse and improve. Clearly those other cases where people ask they are just indignant)</p>
<p>But no matter what, I have been sorted into the basket of deplorables.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Did I make a mistake and step down the slippery slope thinking I had good grips on my shoes?</li>
<li>Did I not notice the slope?</li>
<li>Am I actually deplorable?</li>
<li>Or is it all the fault of those evil moderators ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually this last point is not fair. I have reread the post and - I really failed to convey my thoughts. What is posted there is ... a horrific comment. (I can remember what I meant. I can see where I missed out indicative punctuation. But thats not the point is it.) Totally not what I meant and hopefully would never ever think. But someone I respect has come back with &#8220;well thats not actually out of character for you Paul.  We were thinking of banning your account for some of the stuff you have said&#8221;.  That has shaken me deeply and I would like to know what has lead them there.  And how can I adjust my public statements to better reflect me.</p>
<p>So I herewith apologise to everyone on HN or elsewhere for posting text that reads so horrifically. Even if I did not mean it, I still wrote it.</p>
<p>I also need to think about why I post stuff too quickly, why I chose such am inflammatory subject to post on anyway, and why I did not review.</p>
<p>Fewer words. More thought.</p>
<p>I am going to take a bit of a break.</p>
<p>I have spent many years on HN (and am probably a little too anxious to be this close to 10,000).</p>
<p>Apart from satirical news shows on radio 4, it&#8217;s my main source of information on the world. (This may of course not be a great thing.)</p>
<p>So a break is called for - I check too often, and while Facebook is often criticised by us for its addictive-like properties, I still obsessively check HN morning and night and am sooo close to 10k and my last couple of submissions did feel more like testing the reactions for points, not sharing something.</p>
<p>(Actually re-re-re-reading my offending post I can see I meant to put a question mark (or more ??!!) at the end of the first paragraph - so a challenge to the poster looks a lot like a statement of .. oh fuck me what a disaster.  I was remembering what I meant, not reading what I actually wrote.  It really does read like a trolling post - I can quite see what happened there.  But the &#8220;other posts violating our guidelines&#8221; indicates its a good time to take a break till I have processed things.)</p>

The Journey of Mikado Software
==============================</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="section" id="the-journey-to-freedom">
<h2>The journey to freedom<a class="headerlink" href="#the-journey-to-freedom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I was made redundant in 2008, from a nice CTO job in London&#8217;s City, at the
height of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Now, I have worked in the &#8220;Internet Industry&#8221; since 1995.  Yes I am that old.
And I have done most jobs, from CTO to consultant, Developer to DBA.  I ran some
of the UK&#8217;s first ADSL trials back when 14.4 modem was a big deal, have written
software for the FTSE100 and the footie club.  And so I decided not to take
it lying down.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I walked into a new contracting job, and I hustled, and hunted,
worked my way up the salary ladder, started my own consultancy and landed the
<em>big gig</em>.</p>
<p>It was the worst move I ever made.</p>
<p>I sat in a car for between 2 and 4 hours a day (and I never knew how long the
trip would be).  And I was not curing cancer so I could hardly claim my work was
worth the sacrifice.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="assets/images/m25.jpg" src="assets/images/m25.jpg" />
</div>
<p>I saw my children only when they were asleep, or at weekends, when I was
exhausted. My wife saw me for about ten minutes before we climbed into bed and
slept shattered.  It put strains on my marriage and our kids.</p>
<p>And I put on nearly two stone.</p>
<p>So, as that contract ended, I swore to stop.  I did not need to actually be in an office, watched to see if I was slacking off.  I could work remotely, from
anywhere, for anyone.</p>
<p>And things turned a corner.  I was able to walk into
work, able to make breakfast for my kids, let my wife have a lie in and a cuppa.[#]_</p>
<p>It is not heaven, bills still need to be paid, relationships repaired, the office is tiny.</p>
<p>But like nearly 3 out of 4 workers, my job does not need to involve me
travelling to the same office as everyone else.  Nearly 75% of us could do the
same job from <em>anywhere</em>.  And we could do it minutes from our families, our
lives.</p>
<p>The more of us who make that break, who escape, the more our societies will
shift.  Till raising a family stops being a struggle that tears us from being
productive in work.</p>

<h2>The journey for freedom<a class="headerlink" href="#the-journey-for-freedom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the defining characteristics of the next decade of the Internet is
the vast, vast amount of data that will be available, and the new insights
that data will afford us.  But it is too much data for any one company to
own it and use it.  All the pharamceutical companies will need to share their results to find the next break throughs, all the financial companies will need to
share their trades to avoid the next crash.</p>
<p>Data will have to be <em>open</em> to be <em>big</em> and with that will come the open software to handle the data, and the open forms of working (like above) that will
be used to write the software.</p>
<p>And this is my second journey - I am a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oss4gov.org/manifesto">passionate believer</a> in the role of open source in public sector
software.  Mikado Software is driven to put high quality, open software into
government and public sector hands.  We are not a lone voice, the new NHS Spine2 will be built on the open source Python language (a speciality of Mikado) and the Government Digital Service is not just revamping websites, but pushing the
very defintion of Open and Agile into the heart of UK government.</p>

<div class="section" id="journey-s-end">
<h2>Journey&#8217;s End<a class="headerlink" href="#journey-s-end" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I care passionately about my family, which makes me not unique.  I also care
passionately that governments, councils and citizens all have the right to read
the software that more and more runs our lives.  The right to read it, critique
it, and one day remove the offending code.  Just as we do with our written laws
today.</p>
<p>Software matters now, and will matter more in the future.  It need to be kept
free and open so the laws that run our lives are as accessible as the laws that
govern us.</p>
<p>Mikado Software is the end of two journeys, a company that treats work that can
be done anywhere as an opportunity to work anywhere, and a company that creates
the future of public services.</p>

<h1>Topless computing<a class="headerlink" href="#topless-computing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>(June 2007)</p>
<p>The other day I was asked by a member of staff if it would be possible to tie
the holiday spreadsheet into the master workplanner application.</p>
<p>Now <em>possible</em> is a horrible word for IT people, because it is <em>always</em>
possible.  Its really a question of is it a good idea.</p>
<p>I said, well, not until the holiday recording was taken out of spreadsheet form
and put into something that was less ... topless.</p>
<p>Yes, I got the eyebrow reaction.</p>
<p>However it does make sense.  We do not know what the future is going to hold, so
it is always sensible to put our data and code into a form that makes it easy /
simple / feasible to build another system on top of it.</p>
<p>In other words we should build our systems to be <strong>top-less</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, like in the real world, there are varying degrees of topless.  A
spreadsheet is possible to extract data from.  Perhaps I could write a
Python-server that looked at Excel at one end and spat out HTML / JSON the
other. But then I need to map employeeIDs between excel and this other thing,
and write some interpreter for the weird way the spreadsheet deals with time,
and it would probably be a good idea to cache the dates for speed, which means a
storage engine, and by this time I have written yet another half-assed
application, that still does not handle half-days sick, nor talk to the payroll,
nor know anything about regulations.</p>
<p>But to get rid of it will mean <em>me</em> going off finding a list of decent payroll
applications, and asking if they are topless.</p>
<p>Which always makes for a fun phone call.</p>
<p>To me <strong>topless computing</strong> is really, truly <strong>user-friendly</strong> software.  But by
that I assume there are computer literate users being considered.  Because
user-friendly does not mean it has a nice UI, it does not mean it has predictive
text.  It means that when I want to extend it, it does not get in the way.
(Some describe this as difference between <em>plumbing</em> and <em>porcelain</em>).</p>
<p>If all users could write source code, all programs would be topless. Or at least
have easy to remove bikinis. <a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9"><span id="id4"></span>[#]_</span></a> And that is ultimately why I go around talking
about topless computing.</p>
<p>Because it sounds naughty.</p>
<p>European topless computing directive - the idea that this accessibility needs to be enforced as a competitive need. Owning up banking like PSD2
Making personal data geneuninely owned by the person and making the computing substrate accessible and open - thinknautomatic cars</p>
