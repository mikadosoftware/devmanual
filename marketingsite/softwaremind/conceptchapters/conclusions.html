  <p>The economist Robert Solow once quipped that we see the benefits of
computers everywhere, at home, at work, except in the productivity
statistics.  It has been argued
(<a class="reference external" href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf">https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf</a>) that this
is because we are missing the essential rearrangement</p>
<p>Two productivity arguments - we aren&#8217;t inventing stuff or we don&#8217;t
have demand side drivers in western world - that is we can outsource
to cheap labour (Foxconn and Apple make iPhones) If we see 70s then
people invested massively as labour price was skyrocketing - similar
to post world war 1 (immigration, death etc)</p>
<p>Only when we absorb all human capacity to modern levels or social
changes</p>
<p>I think this is right - but it needs a little deeper
explanation. Let&#8217;s look at architects, project managers and
bricklayers</p>
<p>Also internet not changed as much as washing machine - we see the big
communications changes in telegraph. Internet is changing the consumer
(the out of work ways we spend our time)</p>
<p>But it is still hard to see it transforming the in work hours.  Web
technologies do appear everywhere - but this is a function of more
robots ready to build houses - if only the instruction were there.</p>
<p>We only need project managers because the architects were not precise
enough. So the replacement of the bricklayer will soon become the
replacemt of project manager - the great hollowing out.</p>
<p>But this cannot happen if a business is still the equivalent of a
blueprint - needing builders and somon to actually make it work.</p>
<p>Only a programmable company, can be designed like an architect designs
a building - and only at that point can we look at theory of firm. At
things trading on our behalf, at companies that can be formed - is
this insane? Maybe but that&#8217;s never meant wrong.</p>
<p>I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.  But we need
to look deeper</p>
<p>Software is not seeing the productivity gains it should.  But why?</p>
<p>Firstly we are not software literate as companies Not seeing right
size nor right interfaces</p>
<p>Second we are of seeing marketplace of companies to enable right
sizing But we can define what it is - code as the definition of all</p>
<p>Productivity gains held back by company structure, lack of code at all
levels</p>
<p>Architecture paradox - what we see as companies are not all the
decisions and functions needed - we are not seeing
everything. Software literate company will raise to level of explicit
code eachnof those activities - it will be real architecture to build.</p>
<p>A programmable company is one where all its activities and decisions
are encoded. See Apple and its runbook.  When asking for a quote &#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p>What is a programmable company - where it&#8217;s decision processes are
both encoded, and adjustable by internal (direct coding) and external
(customers choosing or not choosing to buy, take action)</p>
<p>As much of facebooks actions, it&#8217;s resource allocation, are steered by
the mass actions of its user base. It is a vast AB test. Now inntheory
this is true of any company - if we stop buying diesel cars GM will
stop making them. But the feedback is so crude and so long term that
it has little effect.  But the programmable company has much finer
grained touch points and is more attuned to them. More ML means even
more attundedness</p>
<p>So programmable company has all of its activities and its decision
points in code (migration to infrastructure as code) and these nodes
are programmable by internal and external actions.  This assumes more
democracy in the internal decisions (explicitly excluding people is
harder. See the linux hierarchy ? Open discussion, Chinese parliament)</p>
<p>With more activity automated we will see both more effi envy and more
problems - serverless world is where companies have to rebuild their
factories to accommodate software, the grain of the internet</p>
<p>Amazon had to solve these internally and basically released it.</p>
<p>Putting everything into code is the only way forward - from routing to
deliveries to accounts the whole skeleton of companies will need to be
as defined by code as an AWS web server.</p>
<p>We are going to redesign that much</p>
<p>Architecture paradox But this leads to the architecture paradox - by
having a robot do the building there is a lot more upfront work
fromthe architect (coding)</p>
<p>Productivity conjecture
- we are missing the re-arrangement of work - that software literacy may be</p>
<p>I reject utterly that now that every freaking adult on the planet can
communicate with every other that we are not seeing productivity gains
(mobile phone choosing best market for produce)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity
gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is
a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where
every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters
deeply</li>
</ul>
<p>What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification</p>
<p>We are missing the dynamo.</p>
<p>Politics and software</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source - oss4gov manifesto</p>
<p>I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don&#8217;t scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers)</li>
<li>most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company</li>
</ul>
<p>A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it&#8217;s a rubbish decision) so we record</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>what was decided</li>
<li>why it was decided</li>
<li>how to judge its success</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it&#8217;s supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company&#8217;s defining code, do that</p>
<p>Steam factories and the rise of electricity
Steam factories ran to a central Rythmn, a single shaft ran from the vast engine across the factory floor and cranks attached to it. Everyone worked to the engines ryhtmn, physically located along the shaft</p>
<p>Toyota quality cicrcle simply could not be invented.</p>
<p>Culture
Ok it&#8217;s not the dog whistle version here - genuinely</p>
<p>Discuss economic changes (ha join Chang) - the reworking of world economic theory from neon liberalism after 2008. It is highly likely to undergo changes in western world</p>
<p>Now the software that is written is ireducably connected to culture it came from- the liberal hippy anti government culture of Berkeley has had enourmous impact (beards and gpls)
What is impact of Indian and Chinese culture - hard to say from outside. Some ideas are possible - less regexs,</p>
<p>But open gov is almost a democractod imperative
I push Oss4gov but I need it funded by right wing maniacs</p>
