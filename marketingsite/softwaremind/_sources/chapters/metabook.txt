How I wrote and published a book using sphinx, docutils, python
===============================================================

I am currently in the process of writing two, interleaved, books on
software and software development.  The goal is to try and get a lot
of stuff out of my head, so I have room for the next 20 years of
experience.

The DevManual is a much more 'bitty' book, and so it has a number of
themed 'entrypoints' like this one, which group together the technical
how-to's such as using Sphinx, or oddities of photo licensing.

The Software Mind, which I still think of being quite good, is a much
more traditional chapter by chapter read.

The ultimate goal is to, of course, self-publish on Amazon, both
electronically and as those one copy at a time bound books. you can
read about the software beihind `converting to Amazon formats` here.

Marketing, whilst often a dirty word in software circles, is in fact
vital to the process of succeeding in both Business and software
(assuming by success in software you mean other people using, and
perhaps even contributing, to your software.)

My marketing for these books is going to be fairly limited, as I have
limited time and funds.  But I want to be confident I have not missed
any obvious avenues - As always I like to have a 360 degree view of a
field, so for marketing, the unbounce.com's 'noob guide to marketing'
is useful - and I will try and fill out each area in the book's
marketing, and of course, write about it in the books. So very Meta.

We shall work on the marketing *after* we have go to draft 0.1 - that
is a draft of the book that seems to be coherent enough to think it is
publishable.  That is a bit subjective, but I am aiming for end of
Dec 2017.  WHich does not give me much time to be honest.
