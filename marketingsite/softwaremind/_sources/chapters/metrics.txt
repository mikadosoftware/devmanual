===================
Metrics and tracing
===================

* setup graphite as docker service
* send simple events

* technical events vs business events

* SImple KPI reporting on top of graphite
* use that to monitor SLA violations

Done. There are more complex approaches, dtrace, new relic etc.
But these require a (close to full time) dedicated DevOps staff
to get real value, and the value is on the few percent from our core ops
- that is when a few percent win is a Full time staff cost its worth doing.
  


dtrace and python - use it to track a program
Similar to new relic?
