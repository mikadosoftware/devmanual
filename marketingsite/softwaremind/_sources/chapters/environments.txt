====================
Testing Environments
====================

We progress our changes to software through distinct environements - a build is rleeased to new environments.

These are used to test the build - and it is  *really* important to have distinct and seperated environments - that is sets of servers, and services that use different hardware

The most common bugs are ones where "oh I forgot it would do that in production"
