Management, What is it good for
================================

I think Bruce Springsteen's later drafts of the song were much better but it is an idea worth considering



Why do "old" organizations like hospitals understand comparative advantage better than FAANG? Why isn't it seen as a failure of management to prioritize effectively when everybody isn't always doing the most important thing they could be doing at that moment?

telecommute 
- managing is a seperate function
- mission - policy. solve with democracy
- mentoring - training is key of management, but really how often is that
- monitoring
- modelling

The majority of my managers, and myself as a manager was just *herding*.  I would get annoyed and i see same annoyance in people who want X done cause it is important, but I don't see / agree with the importance

But who is right?
At a certain point in skill level things like fan out and patrol become second nature



- get that out of the way with RPA robotic process automation, and you just have
