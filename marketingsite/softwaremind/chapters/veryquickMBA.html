  <p>What an MBA teaches you
I have an undergrad in computer engineering, and an MBA from a top-10 or top-5 (depending who you ask) school. I learned a LOT from it, even though my experience after my undergrad degree was mostly in business.
Businesses, finance markets are far more complex than people usually think, and if you like to learn, an MBA is a great way to build a solid base for being a product manager, or a director who actually understands the sides of the company: how products are made, how they are sold/monetized/etc. and how to manage the overall structure of the company.
Sadly, I know a lot of great product managers, directors, etc. who are former engineers and have little understanding of competitive strategy, market forces, economics, marketing &amp; finance.
In terms of learning, I took a generalist approach, but focused mostly on strategy &amp; game theory, finance and technology. Here&#8217;s some of the key things I learned, which I actually use frequently:
- Overconfidence bias: we usually think we&#8217;re better than the average on something we know how to do (driving) and worse than the average in something we don&#8217;t (juggling), even if almost nobody knows juggling and everyone knows how to drive
- No alpha (aka can&#8217;t beat the market): you can only consistently beat the market if you&#8217;re far better at financial analysis than a lot of people who do it every day all day. So don&#8217;t bother trying.
- Value chain vs. profits: you&#8217;ll find that most of the excess profits in the value chain of a product will be concentrated in the link that has the least competition
- Non-linearity of utility functions: the utility of item n of something is smaller than item n-1. Also, the utility of losing $1 is smaller than (1/1000) utility of losing 1000. This explains insurance and lotteries: using linear utility function, both have a negative payout, but they make sense when the utility function isn&#8217;t linear
- Bullwhip effect in supply chain: a small variation in one link of the supply chain can cause massive impacts further up or down as those responsible for each link overreact to the variation (also explains a lot of traffic jams)
- Little&#8217;s law: in supply chain (and a lot of other fields): number of units in a system = arrival rate * time in the system
Sadly, a lot of people in my class weren&#8217;t that interested in learning, and focused solely on the networking and entertainment parts of the MBA.</p>
