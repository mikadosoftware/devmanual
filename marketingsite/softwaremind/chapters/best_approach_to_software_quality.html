<p>There are always candidates for this. Everyone has a Silver Bullet they think is
perfect.  Well so do I, and as you are reading my book, I am right !</p>

<p>This is often known as the &#8220;two pizza team&#8221; idea froma Amazons&#8217; Bezos,
where a single &#8220;job&#8221; (running the analytics dashboard for the marketing departmetn) should be done and owned completely by one team, and that team should be no larger than what two pizzas can feed</p>
<p>Bezos pegs that at something like 6-8 people, which to me implies either heroic pizza sizes or people with very small appetites, but one gets the idea.</p>
<p>This idea neatly sits in another &#8220;architectural&#8221; level idea - Microservices.</p>
<p>But it also sits with a business organisation idea - Amazon does not have sprawling departments, it has tiny co-operating teams.  These teams form internal alliances and</p>
<p>By mandating small teams, one gets complete job ownership, and the quality that
comes with caring and mission, one gets minimised</p>
<p>It has enabled Amazon to grow with only minimal organisational structure, but some caveats apply.</p>
<p>Famously Amazon has very strong internal Goverance - the famous data sharing edict that led to AWS.  Without this sort of internal Governance, co-operatin becomes way way harder.  Standards are needed.</p>
<p>Howe we take the lessons of amazon and build genuine external marketplaces means how well we learn lessons of governance.</p>
