<h1>Agile Estimation - Learning from traditional Project Management<a class="headerlink" href="#agile-estimation-learning-from-traditional-project-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Remember the basic problem with any estimation for something that has not been done before is that it&#8217;s impossible to be accurate enough for anyone else to rely on</p>
<p>And then other parts of the company then try to rely on it.</p>
<p>Which then becomes your problem because they are delenandt on you and can blame you for not &#8220;delivering&#8221;.</p>
<p>this then likes pressure on you to take shirt cute, donless testing and generally drop your quality</p>
<p>We can mitigate this slightly by enforcing high quality though CI processes like linting and constant deployment.</p>
<p>this shows forward progress but essentially the underlying problem is still there - we are making a journey we have not made before from a starting point we have never been at before (ie out  odebase now)</p>
<p>So what we need is a different approach - reactive project management t - or event driven project management</p>
<p>On top of which we need risk based project mgmt - where we report the top risks in the project - one of which is always always always the code quality</p>
<p>This takes us to todoinator- anatfempt to handle all this and the reprint of the same throughout.</p>
<p>You need to</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>identify a portion of codebase responsible for and a feature set needed</li>
<li>estimate these</li>
<li>publish and record your estimates <em>locally</em> (ie in your ticket system before putting into the whatever jira</li>
<li>manage your actual book of work through todo and your local ticket system - see &#8216;why the tickets never match reality&#8221; - 10x number of commits as tickets in system.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I have long wondered why Agile (well, read Scrum) planning is <em>so</em> simplistic.</p>
<p>Yes, having the team estimate the tasks and then agree to them is, frankly, a
world away from the handed-down-from-on-high estimation found in most companies,
big and small.  Even where estimation is <em>initially</em> done by the teams, I have
found a number of times that the estimates are either massaged, or are part of a
in-all-but-name waterfall approach.</p>
<p>Even a little more sophistication can lead us to estimates that are dramatically
more useful outside the team, and that tends to lead to teams getting left alone with a reputation for hitting thier promises.</p>
<p>So I suggest that all Planning Poker estimates are provided with PERT three-way estimation points, and then thyat is</p>
<p>Planning poker is based on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_band_delphi">Wide-Band Delphi</a> which came out of RAND Corporation via Barry Boehm.</p>
<p>Flow control in networking and Agile estimation</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>team ramps up slowly then halves it&#8217;s rate if it ever missed</li>

(Incremental commitment - a very Agile approach, basically using risk based analysis to judge if those paying will get what they are paying for - at each stage they can incrmentally commit a little more money.  Or as Ward Cunningham puts it &#8220;Can leave with software representing the amount of money committed to date&#8221;</p>

<p>E = (O + 4N + P)/6
stdev = (pessimistic – optimistic) / 6
Combining estiamtes (chances of EPIC / backlog)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The combined mean is the sum of the two old means. 32.5 + 32.5 = 65 minutes.
The combined stdev is the square root of the sum of the squares of the two old stdevs. SQRT(7.5^2 + 7.5^2) = 10.6.
The combined optimistic estimate is the mean minus ( 3 * stdev). Optimistic = 65 – (3 * 10.6) = 33 minutes.
The combined pessimistic estimate is the mean plus (3 * stdev). Pessimistic = 65 + (3 * 10.6) = 97 minutes.
Our combined PERT estimate is 33/65/97 with a mean of 65 minutes and a stdev of 10.6 minutes.</p>
