- enigma and Bletchley park changing to "collect everything". This is the baby that grew into PRISM

- intelligence and desire to see a map and a secret map. The focus on secrets is likely the downfall - openness is such a landscape changing winning approach that sevret assassination plots are steamrollered by history

Intelligence is about constantly drawing the strategic map. It's beginning in 1909 was helpful, and yet it's use was infantile until Bletchley (1/3 of time of a lieutenant naval intelligence)

News gathering is about drawing the same map

But ... you need a map. Not just the updates. Which is what I see missing in modern news gathering

It has been a *secret* map for many years. But it now must become an open map. It is the only way to deal with the politics and scale 


We need new organisations to transform into open simulator models fed on standard inputs - the map of our politics is a software led approach. The NSA understands this but is trammmelled by churchills secret legacy.
