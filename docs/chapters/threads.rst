History of British spies and surveillance
=========================================


Excellent book "The Black Door"
Starting in 1909, Britain started a government department to manage counter espionage and intelligence gathering.

The focus was on domestic terrorism (from the suffragettes) but as war approached turned to hunt German spies (which withblurid novelists and newspapers pumping up the public seemed to have a spy under every bush)

Asquith was uninterested in intelligence and ignored warnings of the Orish Easter uprising. even after Lloyd George took over in late 1916 intelligence was badly used (Lloyd George boasted to the US ambassador he need not have come, Lloyd George already knew what Wilson had told him to say).  However after the undoubted success of the decoding of the Zimmerman letter (Germany encouraged Mexico to invade the USA guaranteeing it would recognise the annexing of three southern states) intelligence gathering became recognised as important - and under Winston Churchill's Home Secretary of the 1920s were organised under one code breaking roof.

However it took another twenty years before Churchill could give full prime ministerial support to a code breaking machine at the heart of Westminster policy - it was his support for Bletchley park, and the use of Ultra intelligence across all war departments that made. Churchill's indiscretions were as bad as LG, and only slowly did Westminster learn to use context - that is a model filled in by, and validated by intelligence

The jic joint intelligence committee was the brain that fed strategy (why there not t here) and operations

But intelligence input far far outstripped ability to use it - as we see in PRISM. And we are seeing a transformation of military we shall see transform of public policy and society to intelligence 

But it was an approach that Bletchley brought - the use of and gathering of all data, no matter how inconsequential that marked the new Uktra landscape

And this landscape taught the other English speaking nations.

The five eyes nations have for almost a century shared intelligence in open ish ways - and lead to PRISM

The logical flaw - all intelligence must feed policy else it's valueless. And at regular intervals that policy is so high level that all other considerations including protecting sources fails

This leading to loss of sources

Sommale the sources open? What where not possible (see china manufacturing figures).  But they don't have them either? 


Additionally churchills passion for action and secret action informed British policy and use of intelligence for decades - the use of bribes blackmail and direct secret action is still with us in kill lists.


enigma and Bletchley park changing to "collect everything". This is the baby that grew into PRISM

- intelligence and desire to see a map and a secret map. The focus on secrets is likely the downfall - openness is such a landscape changing winning approach that sevret assassination plots are steamrollered by history

Intelligence is about constantly drawing the strategic map. It's beginning in 1909 was helpful, and yet it's use was infantile until Bletchley (1/3 of time of a lieutenant naval intelligence)

News gathering is about drawing the same map

But ... you need a map. Not just the updates. Which is what I see missing in modern news gathering

It has been a *secret* map for many years. But it now must become an open map. It is the only way to deal with the politics and scale 


We need new organisations to transform into open simulator models fed on standard inputs - the map of our politics is a software led approach. The NSA understands this but is trammmelled by churchills secret legacy.  

Additionally secrecy suggests from selection bias - or positive vetting. 1940/ taught uk value of checking the background of those we trust - MPs have for example bob Edwards an Mp till 1987 was a paid KGB member. Stunningly
But other MPs have been paid by and worked with CIA and Mossad.

So choosing is often a matter of screening for people like us. Which as we know innselection bias studies can simply lead to group think
Science has a different open approach and so a empirically led map of the world will out perform the secret map 

Additionally the end of secrecy
Facebook and Portland down 

Does it matter?
Syria - trace the success of government (evil) against rebels (hmmmm) down to Russian military air support which traces to Obama not enforcing redline which traces back to Cameron not getting parliamentary support which traces back to Snowden revelations and mistrust of government revealed secrets and dodgy dossier 45 mins - which is mistrust of closed not opennintelligence

I'm not entirely convince 
It's a combo of most government is same stuff (names address, license) so use shared back ends and so forth. It tends not to work without really clear minded powerful executives - i.e. Politicians
