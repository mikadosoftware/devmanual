Management, What is it good for
================================

I think Bruce Springsteen's later drafts of the song were much better but it is an idea worth considering



telecommute 
- managing is a seperate function
- mission - policy. solve with democracy
- mentoring - training is key of management, but really how often is that
- monitoring
- modelling

The majority of my managers, and myself as a manager was just *herding*.  I would get annoyed and i see same annoyance in people who want X done cause it is important, but I don't see / agree with the importance

But who is right?
At a certain point in skill level things like fan out and patrol become second nature



- get that out of the way with RPA robotic process automation, and you just have 

Yours
