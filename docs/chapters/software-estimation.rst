Take a relaxed backwards looking view - summerhill school

Take a experienced editor view - have someone else from outside the LOB estimate the effort based on write ups. And probably average it out

And accept that it's done when it's done

And that you need an organisation that flexes

And have services as the dividing line - cell like structure so if one fails not all goes down but also if one fails to deliver on time not all goes down
