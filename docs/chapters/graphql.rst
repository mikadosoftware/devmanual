"""
We don't think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON."""

Now my issue is that's plain wrong - unless you kind of are storing data as objects anyway, but even so changes to data should be rare and manulpukation common

the stored data structure really does matter no matter how you "think of it"
