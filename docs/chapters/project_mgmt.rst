We all work on projects of some form or other.  Tools will help us.
Working for an enterprise, they want different reporting approaches.
So the simplest answer is to have a buffer - write and read to and
from

Tickets in a parent child chain A child can have many parents (?)  Git
based bugs?  Functional specs that map easily to tickets (spec2ticket)
Unless you write down explicitly what you are trying to achieve, and
discuss it with the developers and business owners, you end up with
three things - some people who don't understand most of it and just go
along hoping to pick it up later, some people who think they
understand it but have forgotten some vital and really hard parts and
think this is going to be easy, and some people who think they are
building something not quite the same shape as everyone else.

The mark of a high functioning team is how quickly new hires get up to
speed - you don't need Einstein to come in if you kept it simple and
well tested and well API'd.

Server to server authentication


"Full on Full Stack"

What does it really take to be a full stack developer?

-


Intelligence gathering :
- economy model etc

Security as a baked in goal

We are aiming for a level of security that is good but not awesome.

This is where the internal threat is minimal and external threat is
high - we protect against threats with high external component and
lower internal.

Internal is best to use a lot lot of audit

Avoiding the google bubble - digital gated communities


- Airbnb has a race issue - people more likely to refuse a blackmsoundingnname. But the solution to this is simple - renters must offer a room to whomever applies - just as hotels cannot turn people away.  But because these new efficient services are ignoring existing regulation and so will need new (smarter regulating if we can - see below)

AirBNb and other "regulation challenging" unicorns are quite simply breaking the law in almost every country in which they operate.  They are, incidentally, raising matters of public policy that are long overdue

How is airbnb the same as European Commission - both trying to harmonise regulation across a globalised world.

Car Charing versus taxi : here is my regulatory change - the car sharing service must advertise its start and leave positions and make the subsequent journey of


What happens when a regulated hotel tries to discriminate (gay bo'nb issue) - they get their ass sued.

The new labour contract: superstars and payment.
http://www.totalsportek.com/money/manchester-united-player-salaries/

So for 2015 Manchester United made 450M, of which it spent 250M on player salaries (holy cow). If we take 20% corporation tax (yeah right) then we see around 80/20 for labour to capital

Does this hold true for other superstar driven areas - finance? Oh yes - here is traders that took all the revenue in a year.

Is Pikkety wrong? Will global remote working make this kind of impact? Not clear.
