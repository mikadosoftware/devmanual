Dev Manual Overview

So place to put all the bitty mind parts



Transparency is part of trust
Why do millebiaps seem to show trust to people met digitally ? Because transparency?

This will become a toctree of the file sin the directory, but for now it is a
list of work or notes on what makes a developers manual for 21C

"How are things developed around here, and why."

* Source control
* prmotoing code up
* having a robot promite code after meeting automatic criteria
* having automatic testing
* build servers
*


Pyholodeck

- source control
- build systems
- automated tests and xml results
- deployment 
- monitoring
- logging
- metrics
- performance testing
- Pre prod and prod
- cloud evolutions (serverless architecture)
- no damn features
- 


1. source control
   5 chars etc.
   but good example of using automated policy enforcement on checkin

2. tech debt and tech assets - code and tests

3. requirements lifecycle (PEP)
   the wrongest part of the agile manifesto
   """ The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
   """
   Ya do need to write down the discussion.
   written Proof overcomes authority problems
    it is also way to get everyone discussing
    this only works with really co-locateed and mission focused teams

4. automated build and deployment (dogfood)
   Look, bash is just *fine*
   pyholodeck

5. Documentation and Marketing
6. openness and reviews
7. Progress Not Perfection (YouTube clip)
8. static and other analysis
9. performance mgmt and measuring everything (and making reports on everything)
10. Automatic project mgmt
11. Risk management
12. have fun, try new things, don't be afraid

* plumbing needed for every project / component
  - error handling
  - config
  - todo
  - docs
  - logging
  - metrics
  - activity reporting
  - governance, style, testing, coverage
  - source code policy
  - physically distinct DEV, [UAT], PREPROD and PROD
    UAT is optional if you have automated testing.
    dont mix preprod and uat cos you will want to release when users are looking
  - dashboards for can I release, and what is governance ?
  


* distributed file systems
  Cephfs, GlusterFS, Lustre, and HDFS

* work queues
  CElery, zeroMQ

* amazon, openstack

- Whats happening in the world - a sense of perspective
* http://www.digitalattackmap.com/faq/
* also want, wars, trade, shipping, energy, employment, poverty, investment etc.
* some kind of model / mapp for the whole world. where is the money flowing / going?

My goal for Jan 2017 is to *unify and streamline* my vast publishing empire.

I will work on the following project *themes* ongoing

* The Software Mind Book
* Campaign for OSS in Government
* Building a business to sustain my family's future.
* improving myself and my relationships

Which all seems nice.

Publishing Empire
-----------------

I have a lot of written words dotted around.
I will bring them all under one roof, suitably laying 302 trails for Google.
