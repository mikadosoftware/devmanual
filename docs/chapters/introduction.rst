Introduction

I have been building software professionally for almost 20 years, (it only
*feels* longer) and recently was asked by a young, up-and-coming start-up to act
as their *technical advisory board*.  They had their vision for the company,
they wanted to use their website as a central plank in the business, they had
the drive and the gumption, but lacked technical *understanding*; it is a
complicated world out there with every other blog giving their must-have-advice
on their pet corner of the technology world.

These guys wanted someone to make sense of all the conflicting advice and draw a
convincing map from where they are now, to where technology can contribute
meaningfully to their business.

I hope I did (and continue to do) a good job.  But it was surprisingly
difficult.  Oh saying "You need to build an automated CI process", was easy. How
to put one together from any number of excellent packages is quick.

But the hardest part was not *what* or *how*.  The hardest part was *why*.

Why should you use the current best practise technique?  Err, *because
it is the best practise* is kind of an answer, but quite unsatisfactory.  Why
demands, context, it demands history and understanding.

But why is vital to being free to make your own *next* choice.  Unless
you are to be wedded to your technical advisor, you need to see the
world the way he sees it.  And then you can make your own choice, but
with the point of view of a 20 year software veteran.

And so this book was born.  It is both an attempt to clearly show the state of
the art in building software in the 21 Century, but it is also an attempt to
understand why the art looks the way it does. I have divided the book into two -
the Software Mind, trying to get the right point of view. And the Dev Manual,
detailed coverage of the main issues in forming a software literate company. The
Why and the How if you will.

This book is partly history lesson, partly diatribe on the software industry and
mostly an attempt to download my point of view into your head.  Don't worry - I
have very little in my brain these days so it won't hurt.  Ready?
