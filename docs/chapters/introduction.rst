Introduction

I have been building software professionally for almost
20 years, (it only *feels* longer) and recently was asked by a
young, up-and-coming start-up to act as their *technical advisory board*.  They
had their vision for the company, they had the drive and the gumption,
but lacked technical *understanding*; it is a complicated
world out there with every other blog giving their must-have-advice on their
pet corner of the technology world.

These guys wanted someone to make sense of all the conflicting advice and draw a
convincing map from where they are now, to where technology can contribute
meaningfully to their business.

I hope I did (and continue to do) a good job.  But it was surprisingly
difficult.  Oh saying "You need to build an automated CI process", was easy. How
to put one together from any number of excellent packages is quick.

But the hardest part was not *what* or *how*.  The hardest part was *why*.

Why should you use the current best practise technique?  Err, because
it is the best practise is kind of an answer, but quite unsatisfactory.  Why
demands, context, it demands history and understanding.

But why is vital to being free to make your own *next* choice.  Unless
you are to be wedded to your technical advisor, you need to see the
world the way I see it.  And then you can make your own choice, but
with the point of view of a 20 year software veteran.


So it's the two kinds of why - why this move instead of all the other moves possible. That means you need an understanding of all the possible moves and their future implications - why means a map. (See swardley)


And so this book was born.  It is both an attempt to clearly show the
state of the art in building software in the 21 Century, but it is
also an attempt to understand why the art looks the way it does.

This book is partly history lesson, partly diatribe on the software industry and
mostly an attempt to download my point of view into your head.  Don't worry - I
have very little in my brain these days so it won't hurt.  Ready?
