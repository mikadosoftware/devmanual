Free Wi-Fi
==========

It is increasingly hard to find wifi hardware that supports
free-as-in-speech drivers - that is finding a USB wifi dongle for your
laptop is becoming impossible.  So I went to the `FSF approved
<https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/tehnoetic>`_ company
`Tehnoetic <https://tehnoetic.com/>`_ and put down some hard-earned
for a mini-dongle and a high gain dongle and antenna that assuredly will
be using a chipset that has a free driver.


Excitedly I am sitting in a cafe about to plug them in, and why not blog about it.

Plugging in the mini-dongle, I get

Hmmm.

Lets start by confirming what `dmesg` tells us - what is the USB device.

::
   
   Bus 005 Device 005: ID 0cf3:9271 Atheros Communications, Inc. AR9271 802.11n

OK. So its the AR9271 chipset, which apparently uses the ath9k_htc driver.
Aha the online blurb (on my iPhone!) tells me 'firmware is required'

Great, I need a binary firmware (presumably on the Atheros chipset) to run my free driver.
This is silly guys. Its the 21C!  I really am worried about the state of wifi support in the
F/OSS world.

So , I dutifully tether my iPhone with my old-and-not-free dongle, and `apt-get install firmware-atheros`

   [ 1916.520638] systemd-udevd[3209]: renamed network interface wlan0 to wlan3
   
horaah - it loads the firmware OK. And renames wlan for some reason.
Ok, `udev` is the Linux device manager, and it is the one responsible for loading the firmware
and generally dealing with devices attached to the system buses.

udev generates rules (/lib/udev/rules.d/...) and those rules are stored in (/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules) and they show me 

::

   # USB device 0x:0x (rt73usb)
   SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:22:75:fd:d7:8a", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="wlan*", NAME="wlan2"

   # USB device 0x:0x (ath9k_htc)
   SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="60:02:b4:99:94:c5", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="wlan*", NAME="wlan3"


So the rules are written each time a new wlan device is found, and the
match is based on the, obviously now i think about it, MAC address of
the device.

Killing off the previous rules and re-plugging does the needful and I have wlan0 back.
I then rerun my tethering script and all is well with the world.  uploading this blog post ... now !
