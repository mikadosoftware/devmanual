Everyone lies.  Even to themselves.  Try not to.
================================================

As a consultant I am in competition with a lot of people more talented and successful than myself.  And if I look around the web, it seems *everyone* is more talented and successful.  I was thinking of applying for a position at a start up that makes a mobile app.  
It was started by a Geek god and mere mortals could not have kept up.  
These guys were just too cool for school.

Now I am sure the bios were not lies.  Doing that to investors is a bad idea.
But really, is having already achieved superhuman levels of success the only
way to get someone to fund you?

I am really not that good.  Conferences help with this. 
I remember sitting in a conference hall, about to present and realised that I was probably the least talented person in the hall.  
Bjarne Stroustrop, Tim Berners-Lee and Guido Van Rossum were milling in the hallways.
What the hell was I doing there? 

So, I think I have found a simple talent I have.
I am not smart, in that way that MIT engineering or Johns Hopkins Medics
are smart.  But I just carry on.

Not like Einstein.  More... Kenneth Williams.

How very British.
