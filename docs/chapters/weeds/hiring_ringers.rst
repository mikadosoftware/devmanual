Chelsea Football Club might be a good example. In the late 1990's Roman Abromavich, Russion Billionaire, bought the club and invested hundreds (yes!) of millions of pounds, buying some of the best players in the world.

Chelsea started to leap up the League tables, winning games and performing well.

Basically they had bought in *ringers*, better players than the level expected.

Apparently this is a good strategy for IT teams.  Well known commentators (oh alright, Joel Spolsky) say that buying in the best talent works in the long run.

This has a few issues with it.

Why complex and obscuring language.
Partly to hide lack of verifiable truths, but mostly, and I learn this through 
bitter experience, that if you do not know how people will react, if you have no confidence that people will react positively to your straight talk, then 
you obfuscate, prevaricate, use ten words when one will do.

In short, if you think telling it like it is will get you shitstomped, you don't.
