====================
Wrong, and not wrong
====================

Most people think the world is a place of grey, uncertain moral and value
judgements where somethings depend greatly on your point of view.  Of course
very few people think everything depends on your point of view (its very hard to
have a grey area of paedophilia for example) and equally few people feel nothing
is relative, that God or who ever has already laid down all you need to know.

Given this is it strange that most businesses seem to think that a project is a
success or a failure, a contributor to the bottom line or not.

I prefer, instead of the right or wrong,  to have four categories instead of two

- Right
- Not Wrong
- Wrong
- Not even wrong

Right is the best possible choice and outcome. It is the superlative option, the
Van Gogh cornfields, the Da Vinci sketch.  It is also nearly impossible to judge
at the moment - the passage of time, comparison to many other alternatives is
usually needed to be sure it was Right.

*Not Even Wrong* is a phrase coined by the German Physicist Wolfgang Pauli - he
was commenting on the work of a student with a certain (and usual for him) lack
of tact, and made it clear that the student had not simply got his answer
wrong, but that he had been working in the wrong directions.  

So always moving in the Not Wrong direction gets you there eventually.
