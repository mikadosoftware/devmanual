PXE booting is the process of an ethernet chip searching on the local lan for a
suitable DHCP provider from which it can then download and boot a tiny kernel,
which is then used to install the normal kernel / OS.#

Its a nice idea for the new generation of small single board computers like
the RaspberryPi, soekris or beagleboards.
