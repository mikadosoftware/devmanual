Slow Code Movement
==================

Modelled after the `slow food movement <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food>`_.

Let's take our time, create maintainable code, one simple thing at a time.

As I get older, I wonder if I am simply getting slower.  But then I realise that understanding the context, the environment and picking the right actions is not actually moving slower. Its just less activity.

If I had to throw in a slight dig, its that when we are in the business of making seven-league boots, we do not need to *sprint*.

For example, last week, I was digging into a codebase, and it looked to everyone like there was a lot of code to bang out.  But I wanted to understand the whole process, where things were, and I just dug around.  And suddenly realised what we all should have realised during "planning".  Two lines of code and we had what we wanted.

Slower. Less code. But *better*.

So the slow code movement.

Its better to walk in seven league boots, than to run faster.
