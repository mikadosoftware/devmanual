Errors and exception handling

Error Happens
=============

Just like the other well known saying, errors will occur in your code.
Golden Path errors are things you spot in development, operational errors
are things that break your golden path, like netwotk woutages, and gnarly errors
are caused by complexity, race condtions and so on.

FIght errors by keeping things simple, keeping it possible to reason about things and doing one thing and only one thing.


- error capture and management - rollbar
- add exceotion hierarchy
- manage user error presentation
- fail friendly
