OpenStack
Dunbars number is an interesting concept Most concepts or technologies in
software have a Dunbar complexity tipping point - so one can just have a website
that is secured by client certificates and simply hand them out manually.  At 12
or so it starts to get awkward, 159 is broken


- security
  Client certificates, and server to server verification

- repeatable builds
  Fabric and bash
  I will recreate a lot of ansibke but that's why

- simplest web app

- sdlc and release process etc

- sdlc and exception handling - log scraping an exception is always an exception. Fix bugs first - zero bug methodology is a brilliant approach - it forces all sorts of positive behaviour

Notes
-----

Interesting store it all anywhere approach
