Gutenberg -> Literacy rates -> reformation and renaissance

Internet or WWW is our new printing press - but programming is the new literacy

Remote working and the new literacy
-----------------------------------

Simplest disincentive to remote working for businesses is the 
sudden expansion of competition.  Businesses compete for the best workers.
Well the best-fit workers, that is workers for a particular pay can provide a particular level of return.

The thing is they compete within a well-defined geographical area - something like 30-60 mins drive.  If a company rebuilds itself to work well with remote workers, then now it can attract workers from *anywhere*. But those currently working there will be able to move *anywhere*.

The leap from commuter to remote worker is a big one, especially today.  The leap from remote worker for company A to remote worker for company B is almost frictionless.
