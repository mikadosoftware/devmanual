Building Servers and Workstations from Scratch
==============================================

I have (re)written this capability many times, sometimes from scratch meant 
assembling your own hardware, sometimes "a bunch of shell scripts".

This time however, its true love. Well...

Workstation
===========

I intend to use `salt-call --local state.highstate` on my newly installed
laptop to bring it up to a state of pristine, hey aint that cool workability.
All my stuff on it.



Cloud
=====

I intend to use a `minion-master` arrangement to create different and new 
servers (rackspace, AWS, GCE) as needed and for Continuous Delivery.
