Email
=====

And here again is my trip down memory lane, interupted by small things like
Google Mail.  I no longer bother with running my own email servers, keeping the
clam-av uptodate, handling spam, worst of all synching with my mobile.  All done
for me, 40 bucks a year.

Admittedly my email is much easier for the NSA to read and for Google to profile
me and sell me ads, but ... well. Hmmmm.

Anyway.



Email is the serial-killer app of the Internet, it keeps on being the one thing
everyone wants in each generation. It has become part of everyday life and it is
vital to manainging correctly.

The correct way is no longer, yourself.  So we shall cover the following later:

.. todo::

   Mail encryption. Keeping safe what you say to criminals and neer-do-wells.

.. todo::

   Mail rules - setting up and managing Google Apps for business email rules.
