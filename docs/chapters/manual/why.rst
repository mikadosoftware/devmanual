Why Am I writing these articles?
================================

there is a simpler reason for writing a site like this - I have reached the age where Homer Simpson is becoming a
model of clarity and reason.

Basically, I need to get the old stuff out of my brain and down onto paper, or at least blogroll, so I can go and
have fun learning some new stuff.

I hope you enjoy what is getting pushed out of my brain.  I also hope it helps you.
