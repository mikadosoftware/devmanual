==================
Domain name system
==================

Get your own domain.

Seriously, stop mucking about and start getting some google juice.

Now, the simplest way to start is using a nice helpful domain registrar.  Do not
touch GoDaddy with a long stick (See `HN <http://news.ycombinator.com`_).  I use
`easily.co.uk <http://www.easily.co.uk>`_.  A bit pricey but they work OK.  There are better ones but for the
price difference, its hardly worth my time moving.

Now, what is worth my time is a good API based way of changing the DNS names.

I *used* to run my own DNS servers in house. Which was fine, everyone was
happy.  But like all cloud things, barely worth the effort now - I like to use
Amazon Route 53.  I have some code for working with them, will OSS it soon I
hope.

Using amazon Route 53 for happiness???
