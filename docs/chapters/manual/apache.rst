Web Servers - why has apache lost?
==================================

Wow, this clean out of files is really finding some golden oldies.

I did have a write up on `Apache <http://www.apache.org>`_, setup, configuration
 etc.  But... these days I use `nginx <http://www.nginx.org>`_ and `Micro-web
 services <>`_ to great effect.

So please see :doc:`nginx` and lets leave poor old apache alone for a while.
