pkng for FreeBSD
================

Well, this *was* a really good article on mirroring FreeBSD's CVSUP
architecture, to keep bang upto date with any changes.  Unfortunately release 10
has got rid of that entirely, so we shall instead cover pkgng.


Now I have a bit of fondness for pkgng because my first accepted patch to
`saltstack` was a fix for the pkgng setup.  And I am working on it as part of
`pyholodeck <http://pyholodeck.mikadosoftware.com>`_

More to come...
