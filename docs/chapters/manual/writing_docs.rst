Headings

:: 
  There is a sensible order here - the "thickest" character is hight (# is thicker than = than -)
  And the higher headings are double underlined, then single underlined

  Heading 0

  Heading 0 is for Book titles and so forth 
  Do not use unless writing very high level TOCs

  Heading 1 is to be the title page for a single doc / module

  Heading 2
