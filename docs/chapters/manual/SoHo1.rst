Running a Small Office / Home Office Network
============================================

Well, this article has changed in the 8 or so years since I last wrote it.
Way back then, we ran everything in-house. Firewall, email, shared files, DNS
and DHCP, and phones, oh dear phones !

These days... barely any of it.  Most of us have GMail on the web browser and on
our phones, share files via dropbox and skype or video chat.   Pretty much all
that is left is the firewall and our own personal workstations.

Firewalls, routers and analytics
================================

What is important now, and possibly more than ever, is the *analytics*.  This
article is about the ways to monitor your SoHo office.

It's useful to look back on these articles - but this is by far the biggest
change.  I have notes on Samba, and cherrypy. All of which have almost no
relevance now.


File Storage
============

Dropbox is *fine*. But does not run on BSD.
So I can look at bittorrent Sync, or seafile.

I will get back to you :-)
