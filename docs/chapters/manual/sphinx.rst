====================================
Documenting Your project with Sphinx
====================================

Documentation matters.

And documentation that visually helps people find their way through
the data, affords people the navigation they need, will help poor overworked
slobs like you and I get to the info we need quicker and less stressed.

So I am reviewing a whole slew of areas

* generating documents from source code
* API and narrative documentation
* Testing the docs and doctests
* customising the look and feel
  - bootstrap
  - styleguides
* Traditional place to start for OSS contributions


Customising Projects all the way
