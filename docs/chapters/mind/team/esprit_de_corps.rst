Teams matter waaaay more than individual contributors

No one likes being told what to do.  So let developers contribute
their next best step.

Discuss planning carefully, have wide open discussions on next step.
Lieutenants own chunks of code. Use Linux development model

At the beginning of greenfield almost any code laid down is 10x. Don't
believe in 10x myth.  Iceland and Wales versus England.  Esprit de
corp

"""The what-to-build skill trumps the how-to-build-it skill every time!"""

So the essence of software org is loads of discussion on what to build - discussion is good example of open source approach?

The corollary to thisnis you can't hire a 10x developer and then tell them what to do. Which is a revelation for allmiddle management. And the design of lost organisations
Basically you are hiring intraprenuers



Social organisation, commit bits, licenses and future income and
reputation.
