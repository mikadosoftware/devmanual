Management positive functions
=============================

* treat every employee as an individual
* don’t try to fix weaknesses, but instead focus on strengths and talent
* find ways to measure, count, and reward outcomes.

That last one - thats the remote kicker.
If you cannot tell who is doing well in a team and who is not except by
"hanging around them and seeing who leaves last" then you cannot measure.

With that remote mgmt is possible.

As long as you try to make them into a team

Team dysfunctions
=================
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team


    Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group
    Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate
    Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization
    Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards
    Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success
