===================================================
Advice to a Mate going Freelance for the first time
===================================================

..

    Things I wish I had done:

    1. Thought it would last longer than one month. I assumed (still do) that
    they would realise I was faking it and take it all away. So I paid extra for
    temporary access to things (rented a car not bought). A year later I still
    was. Stupid. Assume you are now a contractor for five years. You probably
    will be these don't sound like people to stick with.

    2. Think of yourself as a business. Not a contractor - a business who needs
    to market and build a "sales pipeline". Who are you going to work for in six
    months time? doing what? How will you find them in the next three months and
    persuade them to wait?

    3. taxes. Oh shit taxes. Get a accountant and do not leave their office on
    the first day until you have written a spreadsheet and calculated your own
    basic tax return. know this stuff inside out. You are now running 4 tabs on
    a spreadsheet and carrying over from one to the other:

    Business Income > Business Outgoings > Home Income > Home outgoings. Make a
    spreadsheet like that today. Fill it in.

    4. Blog - it's probably the best middle path for marketing yourself. But
    choose your story, your unique take on things. Are you techie through and
    through? A Brogrammer? An outdoorsy hiker, a Beethoven lover? What is your
    (oh god) tribe? Talk to that tribe - somewhere there is a hiring manager who
    is also a member of your tribe. Probably quite a few - talk to her through
    your blog.

    5. Never ever ever ever lie for anyone ever. Politics is a hard game
    especially in companies that are changing a lot, like startups. As a
    contractor you can have a professional armour - you have an obligation to
    give unbiased advice and opinion.

    Not the companies problems are not your problems. Do not take on board their
    views of "if only we can hit this deadline we can make the sales and hit
    100M..." - you should give your real views on the state of the codebase, the
    likelihood of hitting the deadlines and the tech debt.

  Go read the clean coder (with an r) by uncle bob martin.

   5. be your own project manager - that is track in your own system the tasks
   needed to achieve the requirements and the likely ship dates. Don't keep this
   a secret but don't rely on someone else tracking this for you. I recommend
   fogbugz these days (it's for pay). Don't touch Redmine with a barge pole.
   Basically know that the two week estimate the sprint just made is bullshit.
   Be clear on what your estimates are - no need to be shrill, just be clear,
   polite and consistent.

   6. Be calmer than everyone else and realise this all takes time.

   7. Don't take career advice off random people in the Internet :-)

  This is great, but I don't think he's trying to start a consulting company;
  he's trying to navigate a temp-to-perm offer. :)



  Sorry I got a little carried away (then noprocrast stopped me reediting.)

  Anyway, if I was to give our hero here any advice, it would be to see himself
  not as an employee but as a consulting company - if POV at Parc Xerox was
  worth 40 IQ points, in our business I would say POV is worth 40k pa.




Hello there old boy ! How are you ?  Now, when I heard you were dropping the
so-called safe corporate world for the stomry waters of freelancing, well, I
turned my car around and we met in our  favourite pub-by-the-Thames and had a
chat.

You asked if I could point out some of the lessons I had learnt over the past
few years, and what started as a chat, became a long email and now is an article
or two.  Sorry about that.  Its likely this is more my therapy than your
actionable advice, but I hope it proves useful.


Firstly, what this is not.  This is not a list of things to go do now and you
will be successful.  Its far more a description of the landscape in front of
you.  If you are reasonably prepared for the terrain and weather, you will not
get caught by surprise, not spend a lot of wasted time going in the wrong
direction and hopefully this will mean your natural advantages will end up with
you making a few quid.


Which leads onto the first subject. Money.

You are here to make it.  So *don't ever drop your rates*




Money
The future shape of the world
  - new education

Money again (Tax)
Money yet again (Domestic spending)
Small companies, remote working
Evolution of mgmt (the new freelancing company) - acqui-hire and loosely coupled investment. (international tax as a political force, specific exnterprise zones in metro areas, and ability to become a tax-associate of one ie an acquihire)
  -> we are becoming the new middle managers, and our job is three fold -> innovation, mentoring,


* The fundamental shift -> virtual and physical has been linked, and is growing
  closer.

* GeoPolitics -> much harder, but expect metroarea level focus, with the likely collapse of nation-state economic agreements coming in (basiclly no one expects we can keep paying western lifestyles.  SOmething has to give and expecting tech to step in and make it all cheaper is denial)

Expected partial-failure of nation-states.  There will not be an apocalypse.

In that situation, the sensible answer is to have at least two homes. Ready.

* New tech -> The internet is connecting everyone to everyone else (forget censorship, its as dead as privacy. You want in on the new world, you drop the firewall).  But building on that will be green energy, internet of things and biotech. These will make it possible for a mega-city / metroarea to actually work.


* We are looking like angels with no capital.
  We are going to be the new apprentice masters for the new apprentices

* The means of recharging -> developing countries for a year.

* Collectivisit income co-operatives.

*


The end game.

Stuff fairness and equality.  Become part of the rent-based upper class.
