Jamal cannot rent a room

Regulation are laws we think we can make a profit off of we ignore

Hotel quality - when I stayed in ons ones room as a student I slept under my coat using jeans as a pillow

If I pay I expect a bed.  And a fire exit, working marked fire lights, smoke alarms and regular cleanliness and so on.  Frankly none of which my student flat mates ever did

But the local standards of NY or London are unattainable for Azerbaijan- so if we are to have not one global stands but many local ones why are they making a fuss ? Just because they are able to profit by ignoring

Is not more efficient? Well maybe. Let's try having any room rented out meet certain standards (fire exits etc) and see how efficient we get

Or maybe just have hotels stop doing fire exits
