Serverless - not another paradigm shift
=======================================

According to Bill Bryson in his remarkable "A Short History of nearly
Everything", renowned Paleontologist Simon Conway-Morris was
cataloging the incredible diversity of body-types that had appeared in
an evolutionary instant during the Pre-Cambrian Explosion 500 million
years ago. Dozens of bizzare new body types (lets put claws on the end
of a nose, that might work!). Morris reportedly opened a drawer of
previously un-categorized fossils and remarked "Not another fucking
phylum".

This is a little how I feel with computing platforms and approaches in
our new century. A phylum you may have heard of is `serverless
computing`.

Its worth taking a moment on this one - it is going to be a tough
sell, but, like `AR`, I think its where the smart money will play.
And unlike AR, its not a new green field. This one requires us to
re-write a lot of enterprise code.  So it needs to offer some
advantages.

My evolution ...

Serverless computing is ... hard to explain. Let's imagine you write a
function that takes an HTTP request with a key "name" and your
function returns "hello <name>".  In the normal server-based world I
would know which server that would run on - I would have to worry if
it should run there or elsewhere.

Serverless simply has a scheduler that pushes the request and my
function to *any* server in a vast array


Issues
* security. You thought it was bad sharing a
* the solution here is run your own farm of machines. But that is expensive.
  


Serverless and functional. THis seems to be the winning combination.


Simon Wardley (we have already met him on business strategy) was
involved in an early serverless

It's another shift - findev 

It's basically event driven functions, or batch run functions.
But the concept is w don't want to worry about a server before we want to run the function.

The biggest concern is security 
The second biggest is where do I put my data
