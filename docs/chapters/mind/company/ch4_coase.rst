COase and theory of firm
size of firms -> BAML vs google.

New firm

Programmable company:

* the entirity of business is in code. Not in the middle management,
  not in "how we do things"

We can see Apple Run book / operations managemet as the earlu step in this world
But a completely what-if, flexible company will be anle to turn on a dime.

But this will come at costs - humans dont do well and need the sort of explanation and mission and feed into decision making

Imagine everyone having their own engaged model of the company (ciuntry) and arging which is best format.  May never decide? or may just go with flow?
