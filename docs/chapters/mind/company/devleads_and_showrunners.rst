The show runner
===============

TV shows - you gotta love 'em, sometimes people (without young kids I assume) binge watch them on The NetFlix Channel.

At the heart of each tv show is someone called a show runner. They are almost invariably writers themselves. They don't write (all) the shows. They have a different job. Partly it is to keep the story arcs between episodes straight, but really a good librarian can do that. The job they really do is to tell the other writers that what they have is not yet perfect. 

So, a digression. Mark Gatiss is a xxx writer and performer. He has to-created the new Sherlock Holmes tv series (launching a film career or three in the process) and written many episodes of my favourite tv series Doctor Who.

Now the problem with doctor who is that over fifty years it has been uneven. That cannot be helped with budget cuts and so forth. But the modern ten series have been surprisingly well funded and amazingly successful.  And some episodes have been without doubt the best sci-fi on tv. Weeping angels anyone? The top and tail of Matt Smiths first series? 

But I just saw an episode that should have hit all those high notes. Written by Mark Gattis, Victorian Soldiers (good), on Mars (good), wearing Victorian diving suits as spacesuits (awesome in squeaky voice), fighting Aliens with volley fire (Zulu, thin red line, aliens - so high pitched only dogs can hear).  It's got to be great.

And in the pitch meeting it probably was. But ... it did not work well past this. Maybe time pressures forced the script to go without those vital "start again" rewrites. You see all the right elements were there - "lord love a duck sgt major helping frightened young recruit) but the supposed main characters (Doctor who) were just running around saying "you don't have to fight each other you know" while everyone else's motivations were second to just driving some pointless confrontation.

We re-introduced the world's most rubbish Martian overlords so there would be some aliens, but that lead to having to explain a queen of mars, who wants to kill some soldiers despite having no good reason, and a Friday alien who's only job was to meekly wait crash landed on earth till a bunch of soldiers lately from Islandwnan find him, and with their advanced knowledge of steam engines and bandages help him repair his ship, where he flies them meekly to mars so they can .. err dig for emeralds with a laser Cannon that would have altered the balnce of power on earth.  Oh for heavens sake none of it hung together.

It was just one logical fail after another. Why does the doctor have no role other than observer? Get rid of him and run the story through other eyes (cf Weeping Angels). Why is an alien waiting on earth just to give these guys a ride up. Why bother with the ice warriors civilisation and all the exposition needed - and end up with Doctor Who vaguely siding with the aliens while they wipe out the poor privates on guard duty.

This is where (and I have gone on a bit) this is where the dev lead or show runner role comes in. It's  it about code style (that's automated by some good linting tools). It's about saying "why are we importing an alien civilisation that needs explaining to the audience? That's very heavy import with a lot of processing and no benefit. Just import a lighter weight "life force sucking alien", who happens to like Mars for the climate.

Show runners need to be able to say this episode, despite having all the right bits, is nit hanging together right - rewrite it or it cannot go in.

The show runner needs standards - really high standards. And either has to write to his own standards - or stop writing while being the show runner. Both of which are very hard.

So I would have preferred to just go with a life force sucking alien, some diving suits got from (yes, wheee in the African veldt do we find a diving bell?) and a simple Zulu-eque story of a solider learning to find his inner hero in the face of death. Plus volley fire.

Now that's my taste, and luckily I do not show run doctor who, but Stephen Moffat who does show run it, probably thinks the episode is weaker than a good rewrite could have been. And he had to balance getting any episode with getting the better - not yet written - episode. It's not an easy job. But sometimes you have to say no.
