How did Facebook do it?
==============================

For a very long time, sales people have said  "benefits sell, not features"

But it's easy to plan a feature, and see if a feature is used. So by dint of what gets measured gets done, we focus on features

Benefits are mostly how it benefits someone - how it makes them feel. Fell like they are going to get promoted, feel like they are popular, feel like they pleased the boss.

But the new games in town, google, Facebook et al, found a hack. They found a way to measure the benefits

So what every piece of software needs to a benefit feedback loop - something that allows us to tell if the work we just released pushed the "user feels awesome benefit" meter up or down.

We can measure the benefits - and so we ship more code that delivers benefits - thus making our code more attractive !
