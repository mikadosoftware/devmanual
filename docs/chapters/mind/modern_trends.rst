Why is software so diverse ?

Not age, sex or race. That's a whole 'nother problem.  But the
practises are diverse.  The US Presidential election of 1896 was a
turning point in US politics. (** Relate to modern elections) But it
marked the end of a hugely turbulent period of change in Western world
and business practises. Electricity is a great example. Factories were
redesigning - took another twenty years. Best practises emerged and
final result was ford.

Google is not ford. Ford is the programmable company.

This book is a walk around the software factories of today, and an
attempt to understand what the first programmable company will look
like.

Ford's not ideal (1937 battle of the overpass). In many ways the
battles of UK in 19C were reflected in early 20th, culminating in
business coup referenced by Gen Smedley X

The goal here is the programmable company. Like ford it is an
inflection point. One. It reached yet.

But it is worth exploring Most software teams develop and release
software in their own way.  Like factories that have not yet settled
on best practise.  Agile is not it. Trust me



Why - because we are re-inventing our factories We could have industry
standard operating procedures for vast majority of companies. We
could - but we don't.

But most of problems of software in house I have seen is not
developers with timenonntheir hands still unable to meet business
needs, mostly it is two things

- inability to articulate what is needed for business to succeed
- the whole other crap that swamps is all
