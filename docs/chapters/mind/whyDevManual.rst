Why is the called a developer manual?
=====================================

-------------------------------------

Well it's not anymore but it's because of a simple thing

Any business, the biggest sea change the thing that often makes or breaks is the first employee

Partly it's how good that person is

But also it's how prepared the founder is for the impact an employee has - the structures, the regulations and the move to an actual organisation instead of a one man band

A lot of our discussion is about organisations under software literacy

But the manual is about being ready for organisatio  - being ready for the first employee, the first individual contributor


It's about having tests and automation and a discussion forum and about having a engineering culture and ... it's about how to breed software literacy from day one.

It's probably impossible to say what a large literate organisation will eventually look
Like - but we can say what a small one looks like. A literate craft shop we can build, a multinational we are still waiting for.

So this is the dev manual - realmlife examples of how the software mind can take root at a small office small team level.

It's my best practises - and it's intertwined with the philosophy because ... well because.
