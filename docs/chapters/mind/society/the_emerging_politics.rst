The emerging secure computing platform
--------------------------------------


tmzt 32 minutes ago | parent | on: South Korea military cyber command was hacked

RiscV, TCP+crypto offload, hardware switchports with luajit or nf rules. Reactive UI with hardware rendering and compositing.
Hardware keystore with physical switch to generate and enroll keys, user/owner controlled secrets, one-time programmable as an option, hardwired SAK and OS personality switching key.
Real-time security isolation kernel, hardware-enforced containerization with MMU-protected GPU passthrough.

Deep learning and AI
--------------------

Google chief economist Hal Varian calls this “computer kaizen.” For “just as mass production changed the way products were assembled and continuous improvement changed how manufacturing was done,” he says, “so continuous [and often automatic] experimentation will improve the way we optimize business processes in our organizations.”4


Hope and optimism
-----------------

Computer algorithms offer us hope - in a world where 190 countries are unlikely to agree on water being wet, distributed algorithms (paxos?) can teach us how to conorsinatr chnage.  What we will learn in organising our companies in democratic lines will feed into our societies.  War is always bad for business,

Money creation in modern economy boe


Fractional lending - banks create money
Idea is they de create it when loan repaid
But when market crashes and defaults occur, the value is gone but the cash ... still exists

So we are each crash increaibgnmoney supply
And what where synthetic CDOs creates to do - to absorb the excess cash that people wanted to invest

Shadow courts: global trade is being redefined and software (IP) is at heart of it
iPhone is one global standard and no one is going to challenge it


Wider world
- potential for an egalitarian and networked future, with common standards and common interests driving our societies and economies forward towards a golden future

Of course it can all fail to be that.  But this ideal (referred to as 45 degree politics, incorporating the bottom up horizontal community politics alongside the state and party infrastructure that can sustain politics beyond the passion of Election Day) is worth looking for in our work organisations as well

Democracy in the enterprise

"having a strong engineering culture is much larger force multiplier"

 People write a lot about how things like using fancier languages or techniques like TDD or agile will make your teams more productive, but having a strong engineering culture is much larger force multiplier

 Fundamental problem:
 How to reward the person who arrives a day late because they steered around the storm
 And not reward the fool who risked his ship sailing through the storm

 Land how to reward the person who achieved the goal with a tenth of the effort
 And not reward the person who did the same thing but at ten times the cost - because big pr he te with  it budgets get high cosibility




Danluu as competition validating market

Pre and post literate enterprises


Homo deus - Yuval Harari 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow

Argument is that as mass numbers of humans were needed in military and factories to power industrial revolution countries needed to educate and use the masses, and 

Counter arguments - we always needed masses, but the surplus was never sufficient to be wielded. Once technology increase the surplus we shared

Sharing is open source

Open source AI is the most obvious 

And open source AI is not controlled by proprietary companies. In fact the moral decisions are the sort of thing only acceptable at national political levels

So we will not see AI corporations running the world (i.e. Google being forced to reveal its algo)

The competition is still ultimately between those who own the land / code / robot can do what they want, and those who own the land have duties as well as rights and now a new concept - we all own the land. Code is the new socialism 


However electronics become important - and so open hardware is now it just a security imperative but a moral imperative - everyone should have access to these life enhancing technologies 

(We have rough principle now - NHS but not evenly spread) 


Thoughts
AI fallacy
- 
- decline in ad serving is based on AI fallacy


https://mortoray.com/2017/05/02/fix-your-crappy-ads-and-ill-stop-blocking-them/
Why do Nigerian scam emails have bad spelling?
Because it's not targeted at you, someone who can spell and sees it as flawed
It's targeted at people who think they are supoerior to someone who can't spell.

This is the reinforcement problem

Crappy ads work for a shrinking subset of people. But the ad reinforcement is not global sales of a product - it's getting ads to sell.
Somworse ads for worse products

This AI fallacy is also seen in birds that cannhatch a beach ball and humans that eat too much and woody Allen in sleeper and all of Kathy  maths babe


Solution to coase problem
It's about helping each other
My jobs less about telling people they have not done it than making it easy for them to do it and traxknit
Like being told to eat ten veg a day and just changing sugar tax and making Tesco deliver and remove the crap from the shelves

Counties and organisations that systematise doing the right thing get it 

Those that don't fail

And as market place does not offer systematised packaged options (opinionated) then that's the new Coasian cofactor 


Software surfaces moral decisions
---------------------------------
Software demands answers to all the possible options.  Software is changing architecture - see robot builders. The issue here is that you cannot have imprecision at the blueprint level.

So this is "the code is the design". Everything else is artist impression.

But it carries on in other ways. Automated car and the crash decision.
Notifying insurance companies during the crash!

We all have a bubble. It's just now the bubble is measurable. The rise of social media as a tool for influencing political decisions is new. But it's just a tool - we have always had there fights. Always had politicians saying one thing to one group and another or another. But now they have to explicitly program in that duplicity. And we can explicitly measure it.

We need fundamental values to guide us. American constitution is nice. We need more. This worries me most about British politics is a desire to leave behind written constitution. 


Commit mind
-----------
Commits and the rest of the process of software building is vital
Test driven development is important 
But I would break it into write your commit message first
Then force your Pre commit shell to stop Ou committing without 80% coverage 


Why open source and open standard matter

- new technologies magnify power
When it was criminals or hackers with internet access it was transformative
When governments and companies finally started using internet they have sommuch more power to magnify
The internet is becoming militarised and centralised. You can only militarised something by applying pressure to choke points
Anything else is total swamping

But worse we see rose of winner take all distribution networks - Facebook, snapchat etc etc

These gonaginst the grain of the internet - and can more easily be militarised - see the national security letters

Schneier s Cory Doctorow see battle of quick and the strong. And life favours the strong. 
So we want to level the playing field by removing the pinch points. Making it harder to militarise.

Imagine the bad world - the Kafka world where you cannot read the laws or unpick the algorithms.

We won't see any good come from that world.

The price of distributed networks might well be the price of harder much harder policing 

But society can police itself without techno cops- catching abuse etc is a social problem
