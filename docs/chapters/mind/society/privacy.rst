Trying to create a framework 

Preamble
People trying to apply 18th century law to modern tech
I like 18th c law, it was a distillation of thousands years human experience in organising societies and avoiding or impeding abuse of power

As o move through the modern world I cause events to happen, digital Ed tidings to be made - I do so intentionally and with knowledge - perhaps not precise knowledge, that it will be captured read and used

I may do so carelessly, but I do it

It is my view that this should be treated as publishing- that I own a copyright over that information - and even the direct interpretation of that (aggregation does not invalidate my ownership of some proportion of that

This ownership should be maintained - and either freely licensed or paid for and compensated

This dies three things

- google stops owning data about us
- they may charge for access to the corpus but they don't own the individual data or the extrapolation 

- it allows for free (both meanings) access for accredited purposes and researchers - we should assume by default the number is steps I take  today becomes part of a few medical database

- it gives a clear mechanism to spot and stop abuses and unwarranted uses. Installing an ad blocker might be nice. Stopping 

Why should Facebook make money selling its knowledge of my search history. Why can't I get a slice? Why can't that go to charity or to community wifi projects? 

Virtual Boundaries 
We define physical boundaries as important in privacy (power rebalancing policy) - we have innate belief/ understanding of physical space and ownership/protection

This feeling extends to other things we own-which is why online privacy is a touchy subject - it reaches deep inside is

So using physical search lawsa as first proxy for eventual virtual laws is good step and until commonly agreed replacement is best solution

My suggestion for replacement is ownership as abo e

But ip law is merely hundred years old not thousands 

Right to silence, right to leave phone at home 

Does this framework sit well with current legal questions

- Alexa murder case
Here a live Amazon Echo was in a house listening to all the spoken sounds in the house (this is what it does, it just waits to hear "Alexa" before responding.
Sadly a murder took place in the house. And murders tend to be loud things. So the police wanted Amazon to hand over the recorded sounds at the time of the murder. Amazon refused.

If we see engaging with digital world as a wilful form of publishing then simply letting Amazon into your house is publishing.

So the data is private, yes. But searchable with a warrant.

Perhaps we could see Alexa as a butler standing waiting in the doorway. Many many illegal and immoral acts occurred in the sight of house servants - sometimes to them.  But no one could claim the aristocracy had a right to secrecy. Just to privacy

- a second common legal is apple vs FBI
Here Apple is effective Ely building a phone that is inherently private. This is same arguments as putting vackdoors into encryption.  It's a terribly idea as it simply moves the onus for security to the place where we store the actual backdoor keys.  And that's never safe.

cIa analyst comment - we have to find other ways in, and CIA has been suborning blackmailing and honey trapping since the invention of the car so I think they are well practised by now

Medical privacy is not absolute - communicable diseases is an example. But at what point should we be opt out not opt in? 
Google deepmind shared 1.6bn medical records - this was deemed illegal by the British privacy regulators. The regulator wanted more controls and transparency - the direction of travel was right but the means wrong.  This is a fixable problem - basically an equivalent of building a car without catalytic concerto
