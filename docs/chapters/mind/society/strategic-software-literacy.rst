How do we go to CyberWar?
=========================

The western world has most capable offensive cyber capabilities. Cf Iran

It has used them to strategic ends - Iranian nuclear deal

But we live in the glassiest glass house

We need to develop strategic software capabilities to ensure security

This means encryption
Open hardware
Strategic release and review capabilities
Stop focusing on features - yes that means you Agile
Reworking government and civil service - GDS is more important

Hospital monitors and nuclear submarine coffee machines

Internet of shit

The only solution is open - democratic capitalism depends on open and trusted institutions

Best yet system for gov prosperity
Rule law
Free speec
Local national level

But we appear to be wavering

And software once it is written is apolitical - it will oppress as Marrilly as make you free.

It is the writing of, the intentions of the software developer that will determine the political colour of the software.

We are the new lawyers

Russian hacks on election
Protecting German election? What about bugging angle  merkel? We are not clean here.
