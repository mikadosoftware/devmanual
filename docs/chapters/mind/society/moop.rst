This is linked heavily to the attention economy and nine dots prize winner

I see technology as needing to benefit us. We have a cycle of tech growth, bad consequences and trying to deal with consequences in society 

But we could also have another term - that the technology should enable a decision in the best interests of the individual

That is it should be able to not only grab my attention and sell me something but be designed to focus on my long term benefit, be steerable by me, and not actively work against me

Why not leave it to the market? See ha jo Chang.
But basically because we do not leave medical provision to the market (your doctor has sworn an oath, and will go to jail in extreme cases, even if your HMO won't)

But now with AI the HMO and the Doctor are merging - who's ethics should prevail? 

I think I have a clear answer in my head. 


This is moops 



MOOCs are commonplace now (history) but the direction suggested is one where new ideas about security and privacy intersect

We have a fairly clear idea of how massive access to medical diagnosis data may be helpful

But entirely new fields are possible - the collection and study of psychological data

I have often been annoyed / frustrated by media focus on drama - eastenders for example

Keeping up with the Jones's is foolish

Measuring ourselves against everyone's well being is - statistically prudent

With the rise of in-home video (See Apple's Nest Cam https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/supercharge-your-computer-vision-models.html?m=1) we can reasonably argue for a starting ladder to this end goal.

Firstly pulling together study groups.  Small teams with monitored homes. 

Using voice to text conversion and textual analysis (sentiment, counting, overlapping interrupting) 
The most likely beneficiaries here will be corporate meeting recording and automated feedback on how meetings were handled.


Also we can start to migrate to therapy / intervention
