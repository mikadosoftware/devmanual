Massive Online Open Psychology

MOOCs are commonplace now (history) but the direction suggested is one where new ideas about security and privacy intersect

We have a fairly clear idea of how massive access to medical diagnosis data may be helpful

But entirely new fields are possible - the collection and study of psychological data

I have often been annoyed / frustrated by media focus on drama - eastenders for example

Keeping up with the Jones's is foolish

Measuring ourselves against everyone's well being is - statistically prudent

With the rise of in-home video (See Apple's Nest Cam https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/supercharge-your-computer-vision-models.html?m=1) we can reasonably argue for a starting ladder to this end goal.

Firstly pulling together study groups.  Small teams with monitored homes. 

Using voice to text conversion and textual analysis (sentiment, counting, overlapping interrupting) 
The most likely beneficiaries here will be corporate meeting recording and automated feedback on how meetings were handled.


Also we can start to migrate to therapy / intervention
