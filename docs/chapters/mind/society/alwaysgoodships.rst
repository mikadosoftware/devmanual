=================
Always Good Ships
=================

One of my bugbears about the otherwise excellent GDS inspired `DOS
framework <https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/27/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-an-overview/>`_
(it's where all new software that government needs written (which
should be open source) is put to tender), one of my bugbears is that
it's acting more like a recruitment firm list than a list of software
developers and vendors.

You see I think there is a real qualitative and quantitative
difference between "I will go get 5 people from the contract market
and just push them into the client site" and "I will take
responsibility for those five people working well together, and
delivering what is promised with quality"

One of the things that distinguishes a company, an enterprise, from a
recruitment firm is a sense of mission.

And one of the best mission statements I have found is from the
founder of Newport News Shipyards.  The shipyard built and builds many
of the United States Navy's biggest ships, and these multi-year
monster builds require a vast amount of trust from the Navy that at
the end out will come something that thousands of sailors lives can
depend on.

.. epigraph::

   We shall build good ships here,
   at a profit if we can,
   at a loss if we must,
   but always good ships

   -- Collis P. Huntington


To me there is an intention of quality that applies so easily and so
desperately needed for most software development.

What we build cannot just be guided by the scheduled feature list,
what must be the driving force is good software at the end - reliable,
even if over time, even if over budget.  Good software.  To be relied
on and to be proud of.
