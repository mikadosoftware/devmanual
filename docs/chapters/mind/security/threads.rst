- enigma and Bletchley park changing to "collect everything". This is the baby that grew into PRISM

- intelligence and desire to see a map and a secret map. The focus on secrets is likely the downfall - openness is such a landscape changing winning approach that sevret assassination plots are steamrollered by history

Intelligence is about constantly drawing the strategic map. It's beginning in 1909 was helpful, and yet it's use was infantile until Bletchley (1/3 of time of a lieutenant naval intelligence)

News gathering is about drawing the same map

But ... you need a map. Not just the updates. Which is what I see missing in modern news gathering

It has been a *secret* map for many years. But it now must become an open map. It is the only way to deal with the politics and scale


We need new organisations to transform into open simulator models fed on standard inputs - the map of our politics is a software led approach. The NSA understands this but is trammmelled by churchills secret legacy.

Additionally secrecy suggests from selection bias - or positive vetting. 1940/ taught uk value of checking the background of those we trust - MPs have for example bob Edwards an Mp till 1987 was a paid KGB member. Stunningly
But other MPs have been paid by and worked with CIA and Mossad.

So choosing is often a matter of screening for people like us. Which as we know innselection bias studies can simply lead to group think
Science has a different open approach and so a empirically led map of the world will out perform the secret map

Additionally the end of secrecy
Facebook and Portland down

Does it matter?
Syria - trace the success of government (evil) against rebels (hmmmm) down to Russian military air support which traces to Obama not enforcing redline which traces back to Cameron not getting parliamentary support which traces back to Snowden revelations and mistrust of government revealed secrets and dodgy dossier 45 mins - which is mistrust of closed not opennintelligence


- U.K. Has used secret action and intelligence (bribery and other symbols of outward power to compensate for sudden and drastic loss of empire - and winston was centre of this. We can view Brexit as in someways a backlash - outward trappings on the global stage do not make up for shortcomings at home economy.  And perhaps as good arbiter for future - intelligence is gathering all knowledge to centre to enable good decision making and resource allocation

New company structures may do away with centralised decision top down and may be able to return intelligence from all senrory to all areas equally well - iPhones at Boston bombing
