=====================
The New CTO Dashboard
=====================

=====================


Every software team (whether one person or a hundred) has multiple
streams of work they must do to keep their software

I am including "operations" as part of this as most software teams do
this - either directly ala Facebook / Amazon or indirectly ala third
line support.

These streams are

- producing new features
- maintaining high code quality
- operational performance and metrics
- bug fixing
- tech debt
- marketing
- servicing users





For every software organisation we can define a set of capabilities,
and for each capability we can define best practise and then rate our
own organisation against the best practise.  This can give a clear
idea where to focus improvement efforts.

Good description of process - 80 "scenes" - we must must have a storyboard - think the sticky notes
Always have storyboard
Always have interactions between stories
Stories are states???

But always always - must be clear must be shared
