For Mikado Software, the world will be a better place if
the software at the heart of UK and other governments is open,
transparent and suited to the needs of citizens.

Software will drive all the services in public life - education, politics, bin collections.
The better the software is, the better the public services can be.

If this software is open, transparent and free, not only will UK citizens benefit
But citizens of any country can use (and contribute) to better public services.

Through making better, open, software Mikado Software
can make the world a better place.


Position

We are small. We want to be diverse, remote family friendly aiming at
Skilled people with a desire to raise their children and work

That's not us.

Family first.
