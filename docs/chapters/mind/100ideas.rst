- Phyles
It seems Diamond Age is not so far away by now. Emerging are the phyles, tribes of ideas, some social democratic, some autocratic. Welcome to europe candaduu.
Also, you can loose your nation and citizenship, if you turn to other ideas. Become a communist and you become a north korean or venezuelian, become a djihadi and you are a ISIL or Saudi Arabia citizen. Be a bleeding heart bug liberal- and you are a Californian or Israeli. Maybe this is where we are going.
It would be interesting to see, the inter-phyle interaction. Today, the amish phyle and the californian phyle came to a trading aggreement, where upon the Californian phyle would protect the Amish phyle in return for a scholarship on californian schools for the brightest of the amish decendants.

I won't bet against geography - there is a billion years of evolution and it's easier to find someone. Tragedy of Syria and war


- electric home rings will be USB
All my lights at home are )well Lloyd) are LEDs
Drawing ridiculously less power - but with expensive transformers between 240v 50a power circuit and then. All they need is much less power - and 5v 2a is pemty - as are my mobile devices. More and more power will fall on toy he default standard


- data loss insurance
As more and more software has kinetic effect (hurts people) and as more virtual world have genuine harm (celebrity photos, ransomware, swift gateway hacks) people will want to hold software manufacturers liable
No warranty will die off
But insurance will come in - boiler manufacturer insurance

- data rights - individuals data rights and licensing of data - a new form of GPL?? Individually identifiable data belongs to me and must be treated with care. It can only be onwards used or annotated if I consent. We presume open consent - that is any agreement involving data about or generated by me or caused by me passing through, interacting with of inferred by data, is owned by me and is presumed open and carries that open into other areas



- data training sets - is this a picture of a cat? Is this language racially offensive? Is this Pepsi advert racially offensive? There is a wealth of human decisions that can be used to train computer ML but getting paid for that data ? The Ts and Cs for google and Facebook need to change (and they won't voluntarily obviously)

A new GPL - 

- open source remains great because it reflects economic reality and greatest benefit for all. The film with Matt Damon and the orbiting space station. We just won't accept that situation, especially when the fix is one line of code or one license on all data?

Hard to prove when software and hardware interact
MOT ? 
After market principles - in interests of competionnand healthy reverse engineering we want to encourage an after sales market
However we want to ensure that the standards of the after sales market is at least as stringent as the OEM market. 
So if a part of to be replaced, it can be done without the oem being part of the chain, but their methods tools and signatures must be available to the after market.

(We treat software signing etc as a specialised wrench. It's fine to have a special wrench, but you must make its specs available to the after market at reasonable cost)



- sharing data - open data
My Tesco habits must be made public to licensed public providers unless I sign out - so NHS researchers can see if I go to gym and eat right? 


- lost the themes in manual here and discuss them and cross ref - so talk centralised logging and scale here 

- too much or not enough innovation
Economic innovation is basically energy use (Solow x). So right now we are very energy efficient (can talk to almost any human anywhere on planet) but also using carbon sources - we don't have sustainable energy

More innovation - but it's hard. There are two major drivers of innovation and hence productivity growth in the 21 C - software and fusion. Fusion is self explanatory. Software is really the heart of the book but with widespreasd software literacy we will expect to see a change in corprorate and governmental structures on the same order as we saw as literacy spread throughout renaissance medieval Europe - fundamental. When combined with new power forms we should expect amazing things

James watt not only invented a better steam engine, but he has to invent carbon copy paper in order to make his literate company more efficient.

Someday we shall see the like again. 

- basic Trump thesis is extreme form of book great stagnation- we were promised flying cars and we got 149 characters 
Golden gate before / it's all getting worse

Or

How hard is it to keep a hospital clean?

As hard as is to maintain security

All a trade off 

AI and productivity 
Google is a consumer advert company where is the enterprise AI? 


- will aliens kill  us all and why is that relevant?
Unlikely because the technology advances necessary indicate a society that survives a very long time. That means they develop the means to wipe themselves out but also don't do so - which means they develop the social mechanisms to regulate warlike instincts.

Those social mechanism are described by me a s "better organisations" - like democracy, and capitalism

So the more likely a civilisation is to have tech to cross the stars the more likely they are to not use that tech for war, because they need to not be at war with themselves

So this book is about our search for a better way to run the world - better organisations and better inter-nation (another organisation) co operation

Basically if we live in peace, innovate 

First mannupneverest quote:
It's not that we do mountain mountain climbing because we love the danger it's that it is in an environment that will kill you if you let it.

Space and the future are environments that will kill us if we let it.  We need to prepare at base camps



Algorithms and fitness functions
- googles fitness function is relevance search result (i.e. Time before returning to search)
- Facebook is maybe social engagement - time spent reading
- better ones might be time spent around genuine friends, and local friends (community building)

But Kathy O'Neill book shows how fitness functions firstly need to exist and second must be chosen with societies goals

We must enforce openness - why literacy is a good analogy
We do  it allow Kafka Raquel situations if not being allowed to read a law

We need politics that says this is necessary despite the weight of commercial confidence 


New government
Tim oreilly wife says government is vastness ocean and politics is just the waves on top

We are seeing more and more politics turning to GDS style - but this is where we need three important things 

- clear definition of the goal (fitness function)
  (Dog whistle, undeserving poor etc)
   Also issues around CV not recognising black women
   
- openness and auditability of data inputs, algorithm etc

- legal framework - government by what works. The blairite phrase

These are immensely difficult - and especially the first,


- different agents in an economy / world
Real market 
Finsicialisation

Government vs trade unions is basically a civil war amount govenrmyn as trade unions are a part of the government role
