- Phyles
It seems Diamond Age is not so far away by now. Emerging are the phyles, tribes of ideas, some social democratic, some autocratic. Welcome to europe candaduu.
Also, you can loose your nation and citizenship, if you turn to other ideas. Become a communist and you become a north korean or venezuelian, become a djihadi and you are a ISIL or Saudi Arabia citizen. Be a bleeding heart bug liberal- and you are a Californian or Israeli. Maybe this is where we are going.
It would be interesting to see, the inter-phyle interaction. Today, the amish phyle and the californian phyle came to a trading aggreement, where upon the Californian phyle would protect the Amish phyle in return for a scholarship on californian schools for the brightest of the amish decendants.

I won't bet against geography - there is a billion years of evolution and it's easier to find someone. Tragedy of Syria and war


- electric home rings will be USB
All my lights at home are )well Lloyd) are LEDs
Drawing ridiculously less power - but with expensive transformers between 240v 50a power circuit and then. All they need is much less power - and 5v 2a is pemty - as are my mobile devices. More and more power will fall on toy he default standard


- data loss insurance
As more and more software has kinetic effect (hurts people) and as more virtual world have genuine harm (celebrity photos, ransomware, swift gateway hacks) people will want to hold software manufacturers liable
No warranty will die off
But insurance will come in - boiler manufacturer insurance

- data rights - individuals data rights and licensing of data - a new form of GPL?? Individually identifiable data belongs to me and must be treated with care. It can only be onwards used or annotated if I consent. We presume open consent - that is any agreement involving data about or generated by me or caused by me passing through, interacting with of inferred by data, is owned by me and is presumed open and carries that open into other areas



- data training sets - is this a picture of a cat? Is this language racially offensive? Is this Pepsi advert racially offensive? There is a wealth of human decisions that can be used to train computer ML but getting paid for that data ? The Ts and Cs for google and Facebook need to change (and they won't voluntarily obviously)

A new GPL - 

- open source remains great because it reflects economic reality and greatest benefit for all. The film with Matt Damon and the orbiting space station. We just won't accept that situation, especially when the fix is one line of code or one license on all data?

Hard to prove when software and hardware interact
MOT ? 
After market principles - in interests of competionnand healthy reverse engineering we want to encourage an after sales market
However we want to ensure that the standards of the after sales market is at least as stringent as the OEM market. 
So if a part of to be replaced, it can be done without the oem being part of the chain, but their methods tools and signatures must be available to the after market.

(We treat software signing etc as a specialised wrench. It's fine to have a special wrench, but you must make its specs available to the after market at reasonable cost)



- sharing data - open data
My Tesco habits must be made public to licensed public providers unless I sign out - so NHS researchers can see if I go to gym and eat right? 


- lost the themes in manual here and discuss them and cross ref - so talk centralised logging and scale here
