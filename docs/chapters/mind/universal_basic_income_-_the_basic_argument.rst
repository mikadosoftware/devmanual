DevOps has a cost

Good argument from andressen 
- the issue of switching to new industry is not one of stupid or unwillingness. Look at farmers or truckers doing 12/20 hour days. The issue is opportunity to retrain.

And so unless UBI provides a middle class lifestyle it will never be enough

And so we should laser target instead at retraining opportunities
