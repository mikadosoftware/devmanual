Meta Projects
=============


I have lots, perhaps too many, ideas. And I hate to let go of any of them.
This means most are unfinished and thus the really high potential ones do not get as much attention as they should.

I know I will benefit from more focus, but i also benefit from "a change is as good as a rest".  So I want a means to keep my projects in control, without overwhlming my ability to remeber what they are all.

I need a kind of software "Getting Things Done".


My project control will be

* stored in individual repos remotely (ie on github)
* secure enough
* lightweight
* easilyexpansible
* easy to publish information about them
