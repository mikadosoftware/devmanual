So making a fractal snowflake is really pretty simple.

First we draw a triangle. Then snip out the middle third of each side of the triangle and turn that into a little pyramid shape. Repeat and repeat till snowflake.  See this:

A software architect turned novelist writes about how he uses this principle here http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/

First you write a sentence describing the project.  Then a paragraph, then three paragraphs, then 9 the  27 and so on till you have a full storyboard of stories and paragraphs and descriptions - all of which are held together by the first sentence.

Using snowflake method for discovery stage of project is a natural extension of this excellent idea.
