Deep learning and AI
--------------------

Google chief economist Hal Varian calls this “computer kaizen.” For “just as mass production changed the way products were assembled and continuous improvement changed how manufacturing was done,” he says, “so continuous [and often automatic] experimentation will improve the way we optimize business processes in our organizations.”4


Hope and optimism
-----------------

Computer algorithms offer us hope - in a world where 190 countries are unlikely to agree on water being wet, distributed algorithms (paxos?) can teach us how to conorsinatr chnage.  What we will learn in organising our companies in democratic lines will feed into our societies.  War is always bad for business,

Money creation in modern economy boe


Fractional lending - banks create money
Idea is they de create it when loan repaid
But when market crashes and defaults occur, the value is gone but the cash ... still exists

So we are each crash increaibgnmoney supply
And what where synthetic CDOs creates to do - to absorb the excess cash that people wanted to invest

 Fundamental problem:
 How to reward the person who arrives a day late because they steered around the storm
 And not reward the fool who risked his ship sailing through the storm

 Land how to reward the person who achieved the goal with a tenth of the effort
 And not reward the person who did the same thing but at ten times the cost - because big pr he te with  it budgets get high cosibility
