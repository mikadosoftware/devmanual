Politics is software, software is law

Harmonisation, immigration, globalisation
Like lawyers
Policy is imprinted in software. Just as in law
Weapons of math destruction and public policy Pre-literacy

What choices do we need to make as society in public policy - open accountable transparent flexible / configurable


Global politics - whilst the big shocks recently have been towards
anti-immigration and protectionist (brexi, trump etc) but this year the heads of
50 african governments agreed a free labour movement area, as did asia.  So 2
billion people are movong in the direction of global free trades.

as I will argue the benefits of global trade in goods is generally well
established and people are reluctant to give it up.  Thats not a complete given
but ...

And the hidden nature of "harmonistation" makes it harder to see beenfots but it
is in technology that harmonisation is most natural and most difficult to get
around.


The
For some reason about 100,000 years ago, a smallish ape living in Kenya, Africa
started to spread North and East, working together in family groups or small
tribes against the cold and the night.

Science is to all intents and purposes the culmination of that process.

Science is struggling with crowd behaviour
Organising ourselves is of paramount importance
Democracy is a fairly new thing (about forty years)
Globalisation is huge force - like having your iPhone work in different countries?
Uber is a form of regulatory harmonisation

So how will we organise companies

Programmatic company leads to roald chase shrinking size which leads to more manageable org sizes which leads to more ability absorb change which leads to more radical change which has been problem for thirty years and issue around brexit

* programmable corporation, prgrammable live
Programmatic company - transparent processes, transparent metrics available to all and


Perhaps another way to look at it - if you can read the precise instructions on how to build a company, or a house, you can make changes to the house - if you can automrebuild it you can easily improve it

If not you are just left with sticking stuff on the sides.  A near perfect metaphor for a bureaucratic only able to metastasise not evolve or improve

Sompreviously the metrics were only available as you went up hierarchy
Now it's a matter of policy

* productivity
  There are several counter headwinds to western economic growth (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728)

  - productivity as the engine of growth held back by
  - demographics
  - inequality
  - debt (1/4 of Debt is student debt in USA)
  - dropping education

  Producity should be high - look at Kasparov and AI / centaur
  But lack of software literacy is holding individuals back and lack of coaseian-optimal organisation sizes hold back organisational productivity


* end of privacy

Privacy as a matter of policy
Hard to enforce
Secrecy is gone too


* estimation, prediction, relaxing and reviewing
  Summerhill school


* Naive politics and self-serving
Cannot make a man understand something if his salary depends on his not understanding it.

Software and capital
====================

So let's revisit the building architect. A naive look reveals someone drawing a swooping roofline and leaving the actual how to build it to an Irishman in wellies in three feet of mud.

But if we have a robot, it cannot work out to move the foundations over sonthe door will fit. It will put the door there, and the door will fail to float in air and fall over the building fails

So in software everything has to be perfect or accounted for up front

Think of the moral decision of whom to kill on the roads

But that software is now capable of producing houses from fields at the cost of a bit of concrete

And charging for that software will be all you can do. Licensing?  

But open source software will release that - release that wealth to those who want a house not those who designed the software

Capital becomes ... shareable
