Management coding
=================


I stepped away from manabgemt (pull me back in)
But as an example, a grid has been hardcoded, all over the place and is now getting retired. And we left it late.

Some teams did sensible CONSTANT use and have ten minutes testing. Others not so much.

It's a pretty trivial problem but it needs co-ordination and chasing and guess what that's a management job

So I write something - basically grep over the source tree. And then put it on a website and I need to assign the fixes for each team to the right team (who have to test it themselves) and basically chase and cajole

It's all automateable - effectively it's a set of todos that are outsourced.

It's a programmable company ??? Or over management? Icing from
