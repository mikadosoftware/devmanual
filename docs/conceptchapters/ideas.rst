We have become our own agents (all that time looking things up on iphones tripadvisor hotels.com) was supposed to have been done by AI


Project management - noestimates too far but need ranged renegotiations on estimates - error bars on estimates and so on 

telemetry (gathering event data)



- automate all the things -> programmable company
- programmable company -> faster iterations and faster market / product fit
- programmable company -> no executive function???
-> entrepreneur mindset??
-> model mentor monitor 
-> if no labour force then ... nonsupervisor force.  then what is executive compensation based on or for?
-> company chnage becomes the main function - but that's programmaing job...

Future work from Acolyer.org
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/07/150-successful-machine-learning-models/

developing an organisational capability to design, build, and deploy successful machine learned models in user-facing contexts is, in my opinion, as fundamental to an organisation’s competitiveness as all the other characteristics of high-performing organisations highlighted in the State of DevOps reports. (And by the way, wouldn’t it be wonderful to see data confirming or denying that hypothesis in future reports!).

Don't do distributed - yet
--------------------------

99 times out of a hundred your problem is not going to be solved with a distributed processing platform - your data is not that big (see vaez) your reliability not that vital

Solve the problems in order 

- who
- what changes their behaviour
- why 
- 

Build a robust *process* for discovering customer needs and meeting those iteratively - watch your metrics, run tests and experiments - focus on writing business software in a sensible manner 

Once you breach that 4th order of magnitude you can worry about Google Scale problem (GANDALF)

Methodology 
-----------
Agile is fairly simple - it's an *iterative* process.
Barry Boehm had this in 1986 with "spiral model" - where you developed to mitigate the largest known risks at each iteration.
