Data Management
===============

Data Publishing needs to be a business level function, providing
consistent accurate and timely data to the rest of the organisation is
a vital task.

Like Bezos, can only consume data that is published - and people only
publishbsokething they willing to support

"but i cannot get my job done if "... that's not the problem ... the
problem is clean data

The CIA (and similar orgsanisations - perhasp think of Bletchly Park)
have a deep and strong culture of security.  The vast majority of its
operatives want to get their job done, but will not compromise the
security of the organisation in doing so (no-one sticks the password
to their monitor with a Post-It note).  They just don't.  And if your
company wants to achieve security (or data quality) then it needs that
same level of cultural priority.

Simply put, you need to fire the Director of Marketing for failing to
keep his data clean.
