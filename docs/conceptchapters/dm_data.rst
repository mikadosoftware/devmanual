Data Management
===============

Data Publishing needs to be a business level function, providing
consistent accurate and timely data to the rest of the organisation is
a vital task.

There will be emerging "data librarians" departments as a cross functional discipline 


Like Bezos, can only consume data that is published - and people only

"but i cannot get my job done if "... that's not the problem ... the
problem is clean data

The CIA (and similar orgsanisations - perhasp think of Bletchly Park)
have a deep and strong culture of security.  The vast majority of its
operatives want to get their job done, but will not compromise the
security of the organisation in doing so (no-one sticks the password
to their monitor with a Post-It note).  They just don't.  And if your
company wants to achieve security (or data quality) then it needs that
same level of cultural priority.

Simply put, you need to fire the Director of Marketing for failing to
keep his data clean.


Is Europe one market or many?
-----------------
Yes, both.  Just like America is one market but many.
It's just in America there is a strong aspirational hierarchy (driven by federalism / national tv stations) - people in Ohio want to be just like the Cool california surfers they see.  But few Spaniards aspire to be like the cool Budapest or berliners.  And vice versa.

So market transfers need to apply market specific changes - making mining between markets as one company much harder.
