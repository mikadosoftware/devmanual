git and conflict::

Def hello():
    S = “””hello

World
“””
   Return s

Chnage A - hello() > helloworld()

Chnage B - hello(). > hellothere()
World! > there!


What does it see - how much is handled with merge conflicts and how much semantic (unit) testing? Use of input fuzzing? 

Good fit docs needed ?
