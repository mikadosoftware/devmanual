The Metaphor of Building Software
=================================

Discuss "The code is the design", and the DevOps idea of code for
everything.  Look at building site in City of London

The office building metahpr is a good one because it also includes a
clear idea of just how much is ocvered in software build chains these
days - from Steel girders and foundations to Glass UIs and bathroom
and waste services in conduits no one sees, to building security and
power outlets.  These things are beasts, and software at even mid size
enterprise scale is a beast too.  Hence my focus on *governance* as
well.

Why does this matter - why try to be full stack? why not specialise?

There are a few, not many, but a few people in companies like Boeing who understand the *entire* airframe - from bernoulli's principle over the wings to the feedback pressure on the pilots control stick - they can reason through the trade offs and keep it all in their heads

A full stack developer is not just a cheaper replacement for hiring 3 specialised ones, (certainly not if I am invoicing you) but is someone who can rationalise the trade offs across the whole stack.

Similarly for a business you need working models for all the interactions - sales, marketing manufacturing etc. And as those models are surfaced and captured in concrete code they can be shared and manipulated - the more the trade offs do not just appear on one person head but are explicitly modelled and tested the closer we get to a programmable company.

So having a full stack is one thing - being able to recreate that stack in a wind tunnel environment and see it respond to new changes is vital for understanding the trade offs across the stack.


As an example the trade offs start to matter at those "order of magnitude" barriers - going from 10x lines of code to 100x, or 10x servers to 100x servers or people.

Infrastructure matters most
---------------------------
culture is infrastructure 


Submit Queue and any submit queue
---------------------------------

http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3310000/3303970/a29-ananthanarayanan.pdf

Uber has SubmitQueue to scale queued commits - but you don't need regression analysis in most cases - you just need to build and test and do so automatically with a queue - a mono repo or a distributed set of repos eventually becomes a mono repo at integration stage

Everything is eventually a monorepo
At integration testing stage everything is a monorepo - so you need a submit queue to manage the process

Technical Architecture
----------------------

There are lot of "Technical Architects" around these days.  (One of
the problems with not having a software profession the same way we do
in actual architecture is its hard to stop people calling themselves a
Technical Architect. (I mean, just look at *my* business card ...)

A stereotype of TAs is of isolated geniuses (at least they hope to
give that impression) announcing the correct way to build software to
a large team or organisation.

The problem is that if no-one is following yourq architectureal rules,
then you arent an architect.  Architecture is a human function,
persuading others that your way is better.  SOmetimes, we *enforce*
that - through Software Governance (an important idea we will return
to) In the same way that an Architects design for a building is
followed by the builders, or a City Planners rules for a City are
followed by all agents involved.

With a metaphor of building cities, we can see why the idea of Architecture is
an attractive one, but it is really at the scale of the biggest software houses
in the world (Major Banks and financial instituions) that you can see the incredilbe
value of ... City Planning.  We shall call this Software Governance.

opinionated software
--------------------

It has strong views on how it should be used in its domain. This is seen everywhere and it makes software easier to use once you understand its philosophy.  So have an  opinion on how your users should donthings - some users will agree wildly others not so much - but at least they know what you stand for - it's marketing as well as a philosophy 

Workstation
===========

The project mikadosoftware/workstation is the best point to discuss a
develoeprs workstation.  A while back I realised I was spending waaay
too much time altering my worksttion - as an itinerant developer /
contractor I would effectivety be a bum on a seat (in many senses of
the word!).

So I have taken some time to define a repeatable workstation process.
Its not ever going to be perfect but at least it is a valuable start


Workstations are part of overall plumbing.





Plumbing
========

Every software project of any size needs some basic plumbing, things
like a good config approach, a means of linting and testing.  These
things pay dividends throughout the lifetime of a project, making the
simple easy and the hard doable.  WIthout it, you are in trouble.

Plumbing
-----------------

The goal here is not best practise, but good enough practise that can
scale enough for you not to panic while replacing it.
Our golden goal is to keep things simple.

Simple breaks in simple ways, simple is simple to extend and improve.

Its not that simple is *easy* - often it is the opposite of easy, or quick.

But simple wins out over time. Simple gives great ROI.

I throughly recommend listening to Rich Hickey on this subject (Link)

Continuous Integration (CI)
===========================

.. pull-quote::
   
   Re-create your company from scratch, every single day.

   
Continuous Integration / Delivery is probably the biggest boon to developer produtivity
since the rise of memory managed languages in the 90's.

Languages like C expected the developer to write code that assigned a
certain amount of memory for a certain data structure - which meant at
the point of writing your code, you had to know *how big the data was
going to be, in say two years time*.

People would get this wrong.  The biggest security risk for many years
was your program accepting a piece of data larger than expected and
simply overwriting its own memory.  With luck your program just
crashed.  Otherwise the hacker was very good, and the piece of data
sent just put their evil code on top of the stack ready to be run.

Nowadays, the business logic we grind out does not need to worry about
such things.  Instead we have the fun of not being entirely sure if
the version of the code we think of is going to run on the server with
the code we think of, using the password we meant and thats if no one
else changed anything.

Lets call these build services.

Testing - a heresy
==================

Rick Hickey on simple vs easy
  How does a bug get into production? It is written
  And it passes the tests.  So if you have tests, and you refactor, how
  do you prevent that bug?
  Need to be able to *reason* about code. Which is why 900 npm packages worry me.

  Tests are *regression* tests. They are written so that having written some code to
  do a thing, you dont later on screw it up and it stops doing that thing.  Tests are
  almost by defintion, backwards looking.

Soft Skills
===========

Skills for individual developer
===============================

Software Governance as a force multiplier implies a number of things
One is that each individual contributor should have the same minimal
set of skills, and perform those common skills in a similar fashion.

An obvious example might be making good source code commits, and so there
would need to be an internal "standard" for commits. 

This of course implies ... training. Training your staff to be better
at their jobs, something that the commitment-less culture these days
seems to mitigate against.  Things will change - our "principle" of a
change to Roald Coase's equilibrium point means smaller companies, and
greater need to standard interfaces and so more need to train your
people to do it the right way.

Hiring practises - be part of the team
Entry hurdles. 
start with feedback - sprints and retrospectives
Be aware of your priviledge
Begin the difficult conversations publically 
be aware of the likely problems - metoo is just one.

then aim for the culture you want - 

then hire good people

Logging
-------

How to log 
Capturing metrics not logs
Logging as part of governance and security
Logging as governance - everyone uses logging to same centralised monitored logging
Monitor for logging governance - ie Confiedntial / personal data vs proprietary data 


Don't use exceptions as flow control
Don't bury exceptions in logs

The right way to do this is to write log.error(msg) and then have logs grepped for ERROR flag and then log that out to graphite so it is clear what errrors exist

Place that in the project / repo weekly operational report


Business Worst Case "Stop Loss"
-------------------------------

These are the business rules that prevent disaster - that sort of things you would expect a human to say "WTF" about and start calling for help

One thing it is vital to agree with the business is not just what are our SLAs but what are our stop losses - what are the business boundaries that if they are crossed an emergency should be sounded - and what is the emergence safe state to take ?


Lessons from KightFrank

- have a common error raising system - that is not email

- Debug / Info / Warn / Error / Critical / StopLoss

- These are measured at the level of integration tests etc


- invest in preproduction environments 

- advocate for risk mitigation costs in your industry - cf knight frank and Goldman 


https://www.kitchensoap.com/2013/10/29/counterfactuals-knight-capital/

Don't use counterfactuals for post mortems
----------------

What they did not do, what they should have done is not the point - the point is "what did they do" and "why did that make sense to them at the time" - we are trying to work out why the organisations model of reality was at odds with reality, and how to better align the two 

That is basically post mittens

I want to have a detailed exmaple - so here is a functioning, internal and external
web based, docker based complete setup.

Docker AWS

We shall build a complete enterprise service in the cloud - because we can

- :doc:`chapters/time_in_docker`
- :doc:`chapters/time`


This is a "business in a box" - it kind of does not matter what the
buisness is, its just that all the software engineering goodness
that I describe here needs to be ... dmeonstrable - so I have built a
example business (and launching a real product) with it.

Its WIP

* simplest app possible
* adding a unit test
* adding a performance test
* building it under python / distutils
* running it under systemd
* running dual, behind load balancer, using weaver/ansible/fabric
* building it on a build server, using .deb files
* build assets -> docs, perf results, test results, .deb files
* Security on microservice

The top 12 practices - a summary
--------------------------------

Like Joel's checklist, this is a checklist for things you need
Its trying to get ot barebones


1. source control
   5 chars etc.
   but good example of using automated policy enforcement on checkin

2. tech debt and tech assets - code and tests
   "Lines of code spent"
   
3. requirements lifecycle (PEP)
   the wrongest part of the agile manifesto
   """ The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
   """
   
   Ya do need to write down the discussion.
   written Proof overcomes authority problems
    it is also way to get everyone discussing
    this only works with really co-locateed and mission focused teams

4. automated build and deployment (dogfood)
   Look, bash is just *fine*
   pyholodeck

5. Documentation and Marketing
6. openness and reviews
7. Progress Not Perfection (YouTube clip)
8. static and other analysis
9. performance mgmt and measuring everything (and making reports on everything)
10. Automatic project mgmt
11. Risk management
12. have fun, try new things, don't be afraid


Google Peace dividend and Distributed computing
===============================================

THe new capabilities

Kebernetes (the micro services as cattle)
Beam / spark - distributed parallelised computing - the new scheduler
Tensorflow - AI

Functional Reactive programming and DAGs
-----------------------------------------

"out of the tar pit" marks/moseley - over simplified it says complexity is the problem in software, and there are two types of complexity - state and control.

A third type is information failures or shooting ourselves in the foot.  

There are then three fixes for the world

- functional programming for managing state (immutable data)

- but data does chnage - so how to handle it? datomic?? bi or tri temporality 

- functional reactive programming and dag - and what about SAC

apache spark is fundamentally one of these. which will win?? hard to say but my money is one language-data tie ups (erlang mnesia, clojure datomic)

https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental/
https://blog.janestreet.com/breaking-down-frp/

Basically don't waste time on recomputing
Which is why Vitrual don can be a dag


Why graphs matter. And who cares


Scope and coverage

- NoSQL and scale and distribution versus consistency 
- rise of functional languages
- the declarative language we all know - SQL
- datomic and clojure
- out of the tar pit (mosley and marks) - two problems are state and control - functional solves some of state but state of data changes.  how to handle changing data ? 
- bitemproarilty and tritemoorality - date we wrote it down, date fact was true, date we are querying about.

- Information management

- systems analysis 

- domain analysis

- leave me alone i am thinking

- stop micro managing 

- no you cannot have an estimate only a direction.  deadline? maybe. try a business solution

- do it smaller first 

- mission and process wins more often 

- ownership of small area wins as well.


Have a incident response book

Have a run book

I am even going so far as to try serverless 

but this is because there is value in cloud native approaches vs cloud lift and shift - and more value (or less cost) in serverless

but lock-in is real - but is a trade off if the cost of lockin

Distributed Batch Programming
------------------------------

EC2 docker and mesos
http://mesos.apache.org
Example app is a friday night batch that produces the TPS report (!)

Just run something ok !

Then micro services deployed into cloud with kubernetes (different to mesos)

And a data lake ... ???
