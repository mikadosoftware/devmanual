Why is AirBnB like the EU

Proposals - make social balance sheets - force companies to report balance sheets as standard categories in electronic form for processing as a whole - see what is runndown or not  across society

Growing Mary Poppins
====================

We are all familiar with the MOOC - massive open online courses - but, and this is it seems more part of *my* software mind than an obvious trend, I see a huge new space in the MOOP - massive open online psychology

We have phones alamo's glued to our selves, and many homes have one or more permanently listening microphones, such as Alexa or Siri, and with body-cams on the rise, permanent video surveillance in the home is not far off.


And I do not see this as a problem - in fact I see it as *potentially* ushering in a golden age.

So, a slight divergence over the the Khardasians.  This is a reality TV shows following the day to day lives of a family of (increasingly mega rich) California sisters.  I bring it up because when I watch it I am surprised by one thing - the degree of self reflection that is going on - in fact forced on the family.  For something like ten years, the members of the family have been asked by a director to sit down and talk to camera and answer questions like "three hours agonyour sister said she did not like the way you talked to her on Tuesday"

And when the family argues, they can discuss it whilst watching footage of the original argument. (expand?)

This degree of self reflection reminds me of Aristotle - the unexamined life is not worth living.

And soon we shall all be living lives like the Khardasians - no not californian luxury and private airplanes - but guided personal relationships.

It's perfectly within technology reach to monitor each and every conversation in my house - how many times a day I talk to my children, how my wife and I communicate.

Now monitor that, looking for common metrics, maybe AI patterns looking for high performing families, and enable me to review my day with the personal psychologist that siri becomes - 94% of happy people have conversations more "you" in it than you did just now

"is now a good time to pick that fight with your wife"

just look at use of text signals in depression (use of I)


Other reasons why MOOP
- Twitter and Facebook self monitoring (mword at bullion scale - see facebook CISO guy) is really hard and likely to be counter productive - we have taken every pub conversation, every snarled word, and made them searchable.

It is not pretty.  The world that used to be published is only "the best choicest curated" version of the world out there.

Yes by allowing global distribution it has given such ugly words more power 

But we cannot deny they exist - and if we want to fix them we need to deal with the words not suppress them (well there is a degree is suppression - you cannot walk up to someone and say "go home" because that's crap.)



Whatsapp / E2E privacy is good.  Just as video camera not cause vile people to film child abuse, they just filmed what evil crimes they were committing anyway

It's up to our society to find ways to discover such abuse (hands in photos etc)

The autonomous vehicle bizplan fallacy
------------------------------
There is a lot of interesting issues being thrown up around automous vehicles and it's worth diving into some of them because they throw the issues around software eating the world (the architects dilemma) into sharp relief

- The ethics "upfront" issue (cf governance) - hit the little girl or kill the driver?? impacts on global regulation. are you going to be able to drive a foreign car on this countries roads if the software is not patched?? 

- The "it's going to be cheaper"
Not until the death rate is close to railways at minimum.  Tesla is getting sued (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19802284) and claim that their safety is 3.7 times better than humans.  That's good and all.  but that's not the right comparison 

Roads kill an average of 43,000 people pa in USA. Rail has 7 passenger deaths (or a bit over 100 if you count workers and pedestrians at crossings)

So railways are the right comparison with self driving cars.  and railways are between 6,000 and 300 times safer.

If I get in a self driving car Inwant to be confident of not dying on a scale similar to trains or planes. 

We are a loong way from that

seven passengers traveling on mainline trains die.

Software demands global regulation
----------------------------------

We unlikely to see balkanisation of internet - we might see DVD regionalist.  but software will define our geopolitics as much as anything.  software configuration as a tariff !! Look at is your car going to kill the girl or the driver?
