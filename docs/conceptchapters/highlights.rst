Everything texhnical you might want to donin a large orfanisation is as simple as the technical side in a two person startup

everyrhing hard is down to the structure of org

one approach os to make relationships - but this only helps you and makes you kore valuable

the right approach is to increase the wealth for all - thats what this bookmis about
