The role of morale in war battle and organisations - this is where leadership excels 

software is engaged (front of battle?) at the point of user interaction - being used - and further back from that development occurs the less effective feedback the worse the decision loop is - individuals decisions make all the difference - we can look at operational aspects (communication, logistics) at the level of general and then strategic issues at financier and politician level but 



politics and organisations
- the role of politics and oN levels - you can hear statements that are supporting an elite 

the elite trade off - it's like paradox of representation - as long as elected is self aware and going in right direction and making few mistakes (wrong not wrong) it's bearable not breakable

but often the politics is retoric not aligned to reality so much it is the dissonance of totalitarianism- which is of course what a hierarchy of (economic) coercion is 


everyrhing hard is down to the structure of org

one approach os to make relationships - but this only helps you and makes you kore valuable

the right approach is to increase the wealth for all - thats what this bookmis about 

complicated is forst oass - and thats all most entrrprises can ever achieve because simplicity requires constant refinement and expeimentation and its waaay easier to buy that in vendors - who rhneaeoves are enterprises and  conlkicated meeting buyer checklists 

techs talk to texhs is best aolution to most buskness problems - indicating software literacy is a general solution 

All projects are startuos looking for validation in form
of funding - no project is ever new in mind of CeO there is always soneone else whonis closer to engineering having ephiany (phase soace)

so all enterprise work is trying to build something that fits inside current philosophy when outside it 

ventire funding internal

pipelijes of process can be automated and adjusted more easily

a policy manual followed relentlessly 

its all

democracy lies in the approach to understanding yhe decisions we take not in how we take decisions 

management is "specially privledged people taking decisions" - but generally trying to take decisions based onnsxientific priciple of eliminating the wrong

but they use people they trust, take all important decisions in a rush ten minites before the budget deadline 

a better democracy has more people invocled in deciding what is wrong and then maybe voting on what is right - but its much wasier to stay in org that you have helped prevent do wring than not

thats democracy - can i trust it to do not wring
