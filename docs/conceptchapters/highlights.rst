Everything texhnical you might want to donin a large orfanisation is as simple as the technical side in a two person startup

everyrhing hard is down to the structure of org

one approach os to make relationships - but this only helps you and makes you kore valuable

the right approach is to increase the wealth for all - thats what this bookmis about 

complicated is forst oass - and thats all most entrrprises can ever achieve because simplicity requires constant refinement and expeimentation and its waaay easier to buy that in vendors - who rhneaeoves are enterprises and  conlkicated meeting buyer checklists 

techs talk to texhs is best aolution to most buskness problems - indicating software literacy is a general solution 

All projects are startuos looking for validation in form
of funding - no project is ever new in mind of CeO there is always soneone else whonis closer to engineering having ephiany (phase soace)

so all enterprise work is trying to build something that fits inside current philosophy when outside it 

ventire funding internal

pipelijes of process can be automated and adjusted more easily

a policy manual followed relentlessly 

its all 

worker
coder
financier 
oolitician 

anythingninvetween adds friction ans cost 



democracy lies in the approach to understanding yhe decisions we take not in how we take decisions 

management is "specially privledged people taking decisions" - but generally trying to take decisions based onnsxientific priciple of eliminating the wrong

but they use people they trust, take all important decisions in a rush ten minites before the budget deadline 

a better democracy has more people invocled in deciding what is wrong and then maybe voting on what is right - but its much wasier to stay in org that you have helped prevent do wring than not

thats democracy - can i trust it to do not wring
