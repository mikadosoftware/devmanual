Chelsea Football Club might be a good example. In the late 1990's Roman Abromavich, Russion Billionaire, bought the club and invested hundreds (yes!) of millions of pounds, buying some of the best players in the world.

Chelsea started to leap up the League tables, winning games and performing well.

Basically they had bought in *ringers*, better players than the level expected.

Apparently this is a good strategy for IT teams.  Well known commentators (oh alright, Joel Spolsky) say that buying in the best talent works in the long run.

This has a few issues with it.

Testing and Trusting
--------------------

Please try this if you have many teams

You need a better pre-prod testing environment.  Younjust do.  It is not good enough, comprehensive enough, well set up enough 

So build standard build environments and a suite of integration tests that runs against it - and then each quarter have a different team become the tiger team for 

As part of their testing and refactoring day they get to write tests on other teams integration envrinementa - and if they write failing tests the y win a "proze" - swapnround eachbquarter

stops getting stale, not seeing the wood for trees and encourages relationships between teams

Also get the "PAs" tomorganise brown bag lunches

Why complex and obscuring language.
Partly to hide lack of verifiable truths, but mostly, and I learn this through
bitter experience, that if you do not know how people will react, if you have no confidence that people will react positively to your straight talk, then
you obfuscate, prevaricate, use ten words when one will do.

In short, if you think telling it like it is will get you shitstomped, you don't.
