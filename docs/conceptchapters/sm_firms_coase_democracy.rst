:focus: how size and structure of companies is determined and it ain't management cleverness. 


Also: We must include political biases when "asking a software engineer to designing a company" - look at openness and transparency in project reporting or in open source code reviews etc

it is more efficient yes, but openness and transparency are a threat to established orders - only meritocracy survives (look at linux and even thorvaldsen being less of a git)

dictators know this - and what is a CEO but a dictoator in a top down ecology

So democracy in companies might not be a requirement for literacy, but like literacy in europe, it has one end point.

as such gov tech software is a genuine need for focus.

THere must be acoase minimum - how is that changing.
	
Why are companies the size and structure they are. why are some
companies more successful than others, seemingly able to take on more
challenges at faster speed?

these questions are the reason bookshops groan under the weight of hardback business books trying to sell the answers, but they also are deeply important questions for humans globally - the organisation, be it commercial company, government department or city hall is the umbrella of protection for almost all humans alive today - for legal protection, income and environment

New firm

Programmable company:

* the entirity of business is in code. Not in the middle management,
  not in "how we do things"
  
  the approval workflow system is an example of how good but unavailable idea holds things back dramatically. scalability is not just size but speed as well
  
  designing your processes for scale matters too
  

We can see Apple Run book / operations managemet as the earlu step in this world
But a completely what-if, flexible company will be anle to turn on a dime.

But this will come at costs - humans dont do well and need ther sort of explanation and mission and feed into decision making

Imagine everyone having their own engaged model of the company (ciuntry) and arging which is best format.  May never decide? or may just go with flow?

Excellent take on coase minimum 

So in modern world the process is thenthings - a single slip up causes horro - something a s project mange I know too well.  Approvals ...

And so what is needed is solutions to this - continuous integration is tried - but this is fixing things after they gone wrong - just really quickly after they go wrong

Apples vaunted process is to model the process correctly first

And this is my argument for the new company - the programmable company is one where all the interactions are programmed and viable in pre-production allowing choice, optimisationand modelling


The changes we are seeing about programmable company 
----------------------

https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/a16z/id842818711

- Everyone becomes an analyst
- everyone becomes a real time analyst
- we are seeing rise of software mediated marketing (growth hacker) and product management (where the product is reporting on metrics (ie funnel) and so guides next feature development

and 

- modelling of organisation will be means to management of org 

 
- you need software skills not easier tools
- you need application performance monitoring for business processes - internal and external (internal friction or monitoring our marketing response)

why software - because it is infinitely easier to get a programmer to analyse data from five areas and knock up a report than it is to wor it's a tool flexible enough for a non programmer

it's like can you write a tool to let annilliterate write a book? 

and so it becomes easier to hire coders and teach them to make good business decisions than hire business deciders and teach them to code

the last generation is at the top now

### xxx potential blog post 
Why companies are not really command and control
------------------------------------------------

Politics gets in the way.  At the point at which internal polirics (conpettion over resources)
starts haveing serious consequesnces is my view ofr the coase minimum


An interesting blog by google about manifesto

Idea was as got further on in career stopped doing the coding and
started doing the "what needs to be done and how" stuff

But this is precisely what a market is good at. 

Looking at my experience of large companies an awful lot of management
(risk and project) is just competing with other people to be first to
look viable and have a following - thisnis ridiculous Ina centrally
planned economy of a company - you may as well do it properly and have
a market place (tournament style promotions etc) especially as there
is less likelihood of Values conflicts

Of course not everyone Is an entrepreneur- everyone more likely to be
of their basic income is protected.


Also why airbucks.io is an example of project that works in
marketplace but notninside company

A point about Company Size
--------------------------

OK, this is meandering a bit but, company size matters. A mid-20C
econmist named Roald Coase had a great theory of the firm - basically
wondering why a firm would have say, an internal depratmetn for, I
dunno, say, market research, when it could go to the outside markte
and buy it in.  Why hire employees basically.  And the answer is its
easier to tell an employee what to do, and then change your mind as
circumstances change, than it is to find, source, and contract for
similar in open market.

A lot is changing about this.  From Virtual assisitants to others.

But downward sizer pressure exists.  (see note on Google / Barlcays)


Democracies as information systems 

- and how to use information systems to transform companies to democracies

Democracy is an information system.

That's the starting place of our new paper: "Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy." In it, we look at democracy through the lens of information security, trying to understand the current waves of Internet disinformation attacks. Specifically, we wanted to explain why the same disinformation campaigns that act as a stabilizing influence in Russia are destabilizing in the United States.

The answer revolves around the different ways autocracies and democracies work as information systems. We start by differentiating between two types of knowledge that societies use in their political systems. The first is common political knowledge, which is the body of information that people in a society broadly agree on. People agree on who the rulers are and what their claim to legitimacy is. People agree broadly on how their government works, even if they don't like it. In a democracy, people agree about how elections work: how districts are created and defined, how candidates are chosen, and that their votes count -- even if only roughly and imperfectly.

We contrast this with a very different form of knowledge that we call contested political knowledge, which is, broadly, things that people in society disagree about. Examples are easy to bring to mind: how much of a role the government should play in the economy, what the tax rules should be, what sorts of regulations are beneficial and what sorts are harmful, and so on.

This seems basic, but it gets interesting when we contrast both of these forms of knowledge across autocracies and democracies. These two forms of government have incompatible needs for common and contested political knowledge.

For example, democracies draw upon the disagreements within their population to solve problems. Different political groups have different ideas of how to govern, and those groups vie for political influence by persuading voters. There is also long-term uncertainty about who will be in charge and able to set policy goals. Ideally, this is the mechanism through which a polity can harness the diversity of perspectives of its members to better solve complex policy problems. When no-one knows who is going to be in charge after the next election, different parties and candidates will vie to persuade voters of the benefits of different policy proposals.

But in order for this to work, there needs to be common knowledge both of how government functions and how political leaders are chosen. There also needs to be common knowledge of who the political actors are, what they and their parties stand for, and how they clash with each other. Furthermore, this knowledge is decentralized across a wide variety of actors -- an essential element, since ordinary citizens play a significant role in political decision making.

Contrast this with an autocracy. There, common political knowledge about who is in charge over the long term and what their policy goals are is a basic condition of stability. Autocracies do not require common political knowledge about the efficacy and fairness of elections, and strive to maintain a monopoly on other forms of common political knowledge. They actively suppress common political knowledge about potential groupings within their society, their levels of popular support, and how they might form coalitions with each other. On the other hand, they benefit from contested political knowledge about nongovernmental groups and actors in society. If no one really knows which other political parties might form, what they might stand for, and what support they might get, that itself is a significant barrier to those parties ever forming.

This difference has important consequences for security. Authoritarian regimes are vulnerable to information attacks that challenge their monopoly on common political knowledge. They are vulnerable to outside information that demonstrates that the government is manipulating common political knowledge to their own benefit. And they are vulnerable to attacks that turn contested political knowledge -- uncertainty about potential adversaries of the ruling regime, their popular levels of support and their ability to form coalitions -- into common political knowledge. As such, they are vulnerable to tools that allow people to communicate and organize more easily, as well as tools that provide citizens with outside information and perspectives.

For example, before the first stirrings of the Arab Spring, the Tunisian government had extensive control over common knowledge. It required everyone to publicly support the regime, making it hard for citizens to know how many other people hated it, and it prevented potential anti-regime coalitions from organizing. However, it didn't pay attention in time to Facebook, which allowed citizens to talk more easily about how much they detested their rulers, and, when an initial incident sparked a protest, to rapidly organize mass demonstrations against the regime. The Arab Spring faltered in many countries, but it is no surprise that countries like Russia see the Internet openness agenda as a knife at their throats.

Democracies, in contrast, are vulnerable to information attacks that turn common political knowledge into contested political knowledge. If people disagree on the results of an election, or whether a census process is accurate, then democracy suffers. Similarly, if people lose any sense of what the other perspectives in society are, who is real and who is not real, then the debate and argument that democracy thrives on will be degraded. This is what seems to be Russia's aims in their information campaigns against the US: to weaken our collective trust in the institutions and systems that hold our country together. This is also the situation that writers like Adrien Chen and Peter Pomerantsev describe in today's Russia, where no one knows which parties or voices are genuine, and which are puppets of the regime, creating general paranoia and despair.

This difference explains how the same policy measure can increase the stability of one form of regime and decrease the stability of the other. We have already seen that open information flows have benefited democracies while at the same time threatening autocracies. In our language, they transform regime-supporting contested political knowledge into regime-undermining common political knowledge. And much more recently, we have seen other uses of the same information flows undermining democracies by turning regime-supported common political knowledge into regime-undermining contested political knowledge.

In other words, the same fake news techniques that benefit autocracies by making everyone unsure about political alternatives undermine democracies by making people question the common political systems that bind their society.


Fake news: being able to "win the narrative" in face of evidence - at scale, tailored to individual people at scale - usually as in Russia a negative de-engagement but if voting opportunity exists as in brexit it's a positive act (cf dominic cummings )


This framework not only helps us understand how different political systems are vulnerable and how they can be attacked, but also how to bolster security in democracies. First, we need to better defend the common political knowledge that democracies need to function. That is, we need to bolster public confidence in the institutions and systems that maintain a democracy. Second, we need to make it harder for outside political groups to cooperate with inside political groups and organize disinformation attacks, through measures like transparency in political funding and spending. And finally, we need to treat attacks on common political knowledge by insiders as being just as threatening as the same attacks by foreigners.

There's a lot more in the paper.

Good Citation practise

The panic began in April when a video that appears to show a child being scooped off the street by two men on a motorcycle went viral. The video was originally created in Pakistan as a public service announcement to teach parents to watch their children more closely. The end of the clip showed the child returned by the "kidnappers" who held up a sign: "It takes but a moment to snatch a child off the streets of Karachi."
But that wasn’t what millions of Indians saw on WhatsApp. In the doctored Indian version, that ending was cut off, so the child never reappears. (nytimes - https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/opinion/stranger-fear-children-kidnapping-india.html)

But if the video was embedded with hashed frames and linked back securely then it frankly is almost impossible to mistake that - it screams fake

Todoinator and democracy
- writing code that does blogs, release notes, etc from code. because at a certain point it is too big to keep up.  at some scale we want press and media to publish what is happening - so things like tools to show what is happening to codebase will be useful 

it is also part of project reporting - but we all know project reporting upwards is flagrrring lies, so we would like to see a free press as a counter weight to that innthe organisational eco system

if as a manager your job is basically just to tell people where we are going (co ordination or leadership) then as code tools help people conordinate more then what is managements job? it seems more and more like a free press - idenofoting crucial salient pints and raising the alarm

Fraudulent Tactics on Amazon Marketplace

[2018.12.20] Fascinating article about the many ways Amazon Marketplace sellers sabotage each other and defraud customers. The opening example: framing a seller for false advertising by buying fake five-star reviews for their products.

Defacement: Sellers armed with the accounts of Amazon distributors (sometimes legitimately, sometimes through the black market) can make all manner of changes to a rival's listings, from changing images to altering text to reclassifying a product into an irrelevant category, like "sex toys."

Phony fires: Sellers will buy their rival's product, light it on fire, and post a picture to the reviews, claiming it exploded. Amazon is quick to suspend sellers for safety claims.

[...]

Over the following days, Harris came to realize that someone had been targeting him for almost a year, preparing an intricate trap. While he had trademarked his watch and registered his brand, Dead End Survival, with Amazon, Harris hadn't trademarked the name of his Amazon seller account, SharpSurvival. So the interloper did just that, submitting to the patent office as evidence that he owned the goods a photo taken from Harris' Amazon listings, including one of Harris' own hands lighting a fire using the clasp of his survival watch. The hijacker then took that trademark to Amazon and registered it, giving him the power to kick Harris off his own listings and commandeer his name.

[...]

There are more subtle methods of sabotage as well. Sellers will sometimes buy Google ads for their competitors for unrelated products -- say, a dog food ad linking to a shampoo listing -- so that Amazon's algorithm sees the rate of clicks converting to sales drop and automatically demotes their product.

What's also interesting is how Amazon is basically its own government -- with its own rules that its suppliers have no choice but to follow. And, of course, increasingly there is no option but to sell your stuff on Amazon.

Programmable company and bus factor
-----------------------------------

Bus factor is how many employees can get hit by a bus before company loses the institutional knowledge to continue

this has links to the director hazing - you have to be able to operate the levers even if the levers are dumbawful systems

but programmable company surfaces the institutional knowledge and encodes it - it may be more effort like an architect programming robot but once done it is explicit modellabke and open for A/B testing 

And so we see reduction in bus factor - in fact perhaps a bus factor of zero is needed

And this means most human creative work will be in finding and building companies that have product market fit - a coase dilemma perhaps - we can reduce the company size to zero ? 

Only antagonist parts are brand, changing market place, reliability of suppliers ? 

Let's look at the advantages of AWS over doing it ourselves. The guardian found that openstack was too much to do it alone. Mostly because the advantages of specialisation have accrued to Aws - they can afford to have someone whose a Kubernetes developer focusing on that solely ehwrreas guardian and even major banks can only have someone who knows how to use it

the size of core teams in even major banks is surprisingly small - and that means the firehouse hits you all - whereas even a little bit bigger means the firehoase can be avoided
