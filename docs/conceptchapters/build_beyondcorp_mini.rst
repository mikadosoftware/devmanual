Fly.io takes Docker containers from users and converts them to Firecracker micro-VMs running on our hardware around the world, hooked via WireGuard to a global Anycast network, managed Postgres databases, LVM2 volumes, an industrial-scale metrics cluster, a high-performance messaging-based logging system, all coordinated by a global orchestration system. You don't have to know any of this to use Fly.io: if you have a working container, it can be running in Singapore, SÃ£o Paolo, and Sunnyvale in just a couple minutes.
