The economist Robert Solow once quipped that we see the benefits of
computers everywhere, at home, at work, except in the productivity
statistics.  It has been argued
(https://eml.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/e124/David90_dynamo.pdf) that this
is because we are missing the essential rearrangement

Two productivity arguments - we aren't inventing stuff or we don't
have demand side drivers in western world - that is we can outsource
to cheap labour (Foxconn and Apple make iPhones) If we see 70s then
people invested massively as labour price was skyrocketing - similar
to post world war 1 (immigration, death etc)

Only when we absorb all human capacity to modern levels or social
changes

I think this is right - but it needs a little deeper
explanation. Let's look at architects, project managers and
bricklayers

Also internet not changed as much as washing machine - we see the big
communications changes in telegraph. Internet is changing the consumer
(the out of work ways we spend our time)

But it is still hard to see it transforming the in work hours.  Web
technologies do appear everywhere - but this is a function of more
robots ready to build houses - if only the instruction were there.



We only need project managers because the architects were not precise
enough. So the replacement of the bricklayer will soon become the
replacemt of project manager - the great hollowing out.

But this cannot happen if a business is still the equivalent of a
blueprint - needing builders and somon to actually make it work.

Only a programmable company, can be designed like an architect designs
a building - and only at that point can we look at theory of firm. At
things trading on our behalf, at companies that can be formed - is
this insane? Maybe but that's never meant wrong.


I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.  But we need
to look deeper

Software is not seeing the productivity gains it should.  But why?

Firstly we are not software literate as companies Not seeing right
size nor right interfaces

Second we are of seeing marketplace of companies to enable right
sizing But we can define what it is - code as the definition of all


Productivity gains held back by company structure, lack of code at all
levels

Architecture paradox - what we see as companies are not all the
decisions and functions needed - we are not seeing
everything. Software literate company will raise to level of explicit
code eachnof those activities - it will be real architecture to build.

A programmable company is one where all its activities and decisions
are encoded. See Apple and its runbook.  When asking for a quote ""


What is a programmable company - where it's decision processes are
both encoded, and adjustable by internal (direct coding) and external
(customers choosing or not choosing to buy, take action)

As much of facebooks actions, it's resource allocation, are steered by
the mass actions of its user base. It is a vast AB test. Now inntheory
this is true of any company - if we stop buying diesel cars GM will
stop making them. But the feedback is so crude and so long term that
it has little effect.  But the programmable company has much finer
grained touch points and is more attuned to them. More ML means even
more attundedness


So programmable company has all of its activities and its decision
points in code (migration to infrastructure as code) and these nodes
are programmable by internal and external actions.  This assumes more
democracy in the internal decisions (explicitly excluding people is
harder. See the linux hierarchy ? Open discussion, Chinese parliament)

With more activity automated we will see both more effi envy and more
problems - serverless world is where companies have to rebuild their
factories to accommodate software, the grain of the internet

Amazon had to solve these internally and basically released it.

Putting everything into code is the only way forward - from routing to
deliveries to accounts the whole skeleton of companies will need to be
as defined by code as an AWS web server.

We are going to redesign that much


Architecture paradox But this leads to the architecture paradox - by
having a robot do the building there is a lot more upfront work
fromthe architect (coding)

Productivity conjecture
- we are missing the re-arrangement of work - that software literacy may be 

I reject utterly that now that every freaking adult on the planet can
communicate with every other that we are not seeing productivity gains
(mobile phone choosing best market for produce)

- biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity
  gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is
  a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where
  every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters
  deeply

What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification

We are missing the dynamo. 


Kaizen vs Kaikaku
-----------------

Run the company vs change the company

Incremental change (AB testing) vs Radical change

WHy not SaaS
------------

BEcause I *should* be able to do:

::

   authenticate('mycompany')
   for employee in get_all_my_employees():
       if employee.isTimesheetComplete:
           approve_payroll(employee)
	   send_payment_to_bank(employee)
	   send_email_to_employee(employee, template="youarepaid")

Now, there is a lot of noise about IFTT and all the SaaS providers and
so on but - they are wrong.

The above is the *right* way.

It just is.  You know it is.


Operations
----------
Severity Levels
usually maps to customer impact

(Apologies to Abraham Lincoln)

* All of the people cannot use all of it, all of the time
* All of the people cannot use some of it, all of the time
* Some of the people cannot use all of it
* Some of the people cannot use some of it
* Some of our capacity or redundnacy is lost, but no people are affected
* Everything Else

Is like a DefCon - actual *action* is required and defined and taken
(ie customer support portal is updated, these people are notified.)

This is *still* a programmable company - only we did not programm it
to deal with this situation and so it needs to be worked *on* not *in*


Politics and software
----------------------

- new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008
Open source - oss4gov manifesto



I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together

- coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.


I don't think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don't scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo. 

- faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers) 
- most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company

A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software

So let's imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it's a rubbish decision) so we record 

- what was decided
- why it was decided
- how to judge its success

This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase 


Summary

If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it's supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company's defining code, do that




Steam factories and the rise of electricity
Steam factories ran to a central Rythmn, a single shaft ran from the vast engine across the factory floor and cranks attached to it. Everyone worked to the engines ryhtmn, physically located along the shaft

Toyota quality cicrcle simply could not be invented.



Culture 
Ok it's not the dog whistle version here - genuinely

Discuss economic changes (ha join Chang) - the reworking of world economic theory from neon liberalism after 2008. It is highly likely to undergo changes in western world

Now the software that is written is ireducably connected to culture it came from- the liberal hippy anti government culture of Berkeley has had enourmous impact (beards and gpls)
What is impact of Indian and Chinese culture - hard to say from outside. Some ideas are possible - less regexs, 

But open gov is almost a democractod imperative
I push Oss4gov but I need it funded by right wing maniacs


Steven Soderburgh shots his films on iphones - he does camera and editing "two more conversations Indont need to have"

It's this speed of decision making and reduction in friction that programmable company aims to produce - but it runs up against bad decision making of start ups in ethics feee regulation free environment

Facebook and radio lab podcast
expand a lot
Centralising has lead to trying to moderate at billion people scale - this leads to facebook moderation currently at 16,000 people looking at a million flagged items a day

the trade off between better (western cultural) norms (!) and raising the floor and being able to deal with granularity 

It most reminds me of the rowntrees model village - where they tried to make perfect community
Which is nice but it did not work for everyone and it chafed a lot and eventually people moved out because they wanted different freedoms - 

walled garden is nice but if you cannot build on the garden and create your own house and community then ... you will eventually outgrow it

Problems with PageRank
----------------------

Facebook and youtube etc are aggregators - and a problem with Pagerank leads to a global feedback loop - that google (the essential search engine) assumes that a *domain* that has high quality in one location has high quality across the board.

So facebook.com/newyorktimes is seen as good content by google.  And then facebook.com/grotmoron gets that same level of google juice.

This means that if you want your web page to be found by google it is waaaay better to put it on facebook than on your own domain

this leads to positive feedback loop for aggregators and a negative one for the domain based internet (which is how it is designed)

but this is a flawed google (search engine) view - in other words facebook is assumed to be guaranteeing quality of all its content - which effectively makes it a publisher (the big radiolab discussion on moderation at scale)

so some form of regulation for search engine seems sensible - ie something in robots.txt that tells you the site structure and site governance (ie this bit we publish, this bit is platform


Software Socialist
------------------

We live in utopian socialist society
VC funding is just ensuring nice middle class life not threatens when trying to build company

But point of (most) companies is not wealth creation (!) - Facebook just took ad revenue from Fifth Avenue
Amazon just moves sales from Walmart to amazon

But the organisational changes needed to achieve this are profound and deep - building amazon was an amazing acheieneltnt - and it is in the organisational format that government follows - government invests stem for long term wealth creation (new forms tech) and business takes that invention and innovates new product forms and new organisational forms to distribute the created wealth (or rather wealth only creates when it is distributed)

As such my predilection got expenreinifn with governance forms in organisations - why Debian is a bigger idea than its distbuttion


social media - it turns out that social media was actually public publishing - (Zuckerbetgs pivot to person to person messaging) - and that newspapers were curators of publishing - journalism was about deciding what gets putinot oublic sphere.  

democratic journalism is important - social media was a way of allowing people to publish something important  (mexico drug wars) or crap (influencers) - somehow we need good ways to find facts and raise them to consciousness - a backlog of issues and a store of facts


The new socialism - of the character
---------------------
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19661601

Companies will chnage to be more open because the benefits of the MOOP

Look at graduates of today - well adjusted renaissance people with little desire / experience to kill maim.

Was this how we imagined the future in 1800? No - yet we are what changed more than the world - we could not take the 1750 mindset into a car / modern world - it's not a question  of technical skills - it's about character and attitude 

it's basically why putin cannot take his country further - it's the reason the drunk cannot crawl out of the bottle.

It's about choice. 

Keanau would know 



Science funding and support
----------------------------

Are we seeing drop off in support for science and technology? Well, poets don't tend to compose eulogies for scientists buried in st. paul's very much like Newton? (maybe hawking?)

We are seeing explanation exponent change

what makes rocket ships go up - funding makes rockets go up - no bucks no buck rogers.

Funding comes from support - which comes from understanding why the next step counts - this is education

I am doing important experiments for kids and Inam 500 years behind !!

education funding comes first 

Statistical socialist
---------------------
I am a statistical socialist - i believe that every human being born in the planet is born within a narrow normal distribution for all of their attributes - intelligence, height, weight, good looks and sexual size (!) - and where their life outcomes are greater than the range of their distribution i believe those outcomes are influenced more by structural and systemic factors, and then by their character 


Rise (return) of curation
--------------------------
Death of the newsfeed 
https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed
Newsfeed is going as facebook signals peer to peer focus (snapshot stories taking their toll)
But this implies rise again of journalism - who do i follow which leads to newspapers with opinions - but at least they are open accountable opinions (cf murdoch scandals)

It's going to be around picking out sample bias really really well

Seems to me to create multiple models using random selections of same training sets and then see if models come up with similar answers - can build statistical models around that.

find a statistician??? 

Predistribution
---------------

Roberto Unger - changing the market structure of it is unfair so that redistribution is not always swimming up stream

"A billionaire is an example of market failure" (me)

Progressive politics seems to be engaged in harm reduction for their opponents 

Brexit
------
The big takeaway here is the constraining of executive powers on international scene - Uvettee cooper oliver lwtwin bill - seen in congress refusing to ratify treaties with dubbya - this is greater recognition of gloablisation - not just trade between boundaries but with services and regulation a merging and porous nature of boundaries  - and a search for legislative approval - a search for democratic approval against executive power - truly reflecting the new power balance infra companies

We have well tested ways of using science to discover facts

we have ways of using engineering science to discover facts about machines

we are starting to use those lessons to run software system
then we shall use same engineering and statistical principles to find facts on the rest of the pyroamid - how to better run organisations 
and then societies

and we shall do so if we choose the right metrics to be guided by
