Landscape and strategy
======================

The landscape, climate and doctrine from sun-tau determine strategy and the ins and out Avery well

Doctrine - like a style guide or dev manual for developers

But the landscape of software is often seen as magic by the ore-literate
And it's why algorithms matter



So it's the two kinds of why - why this move instead of all the other moves possible. That means you need an understanding of all the possible moves and their future implications - why means a map.

Swardley evolution as a Wodehouse approach to building viable software - it cannot be perfect out the gate and this gives is a value based evolution for the service (soa microservice api approach)

Simple to complex roadmaps
==========================


Swardley??

One of the important things in software, perhaps the most important, is to keep things simple.
As the needs of an organisation grow, the complexity of the systems it uses increases.
I show here, in each section, a roadmap of complexity.  The base simplicity levels are
expected to give the fundamental understanding of the problems, but give way fgracefully to
new, (ope source) solutions that do the same thing as the simple system, but have extra more useful features.

FOr example, in configuration and co-ordination, we start with just a init file style API that reads from a text file
telling us what config data exists for our systems.  This is *fine* but it really quickly hits limits.
SOmething like APache Zookeeper is the next logical step, but that is waay more complicated to set up.
So we start witht he simplest possible, and point to where to take the next steps.
