Ask a Software Engineer to design Project Management
====================================================

<Name>, an influential Googler who helped popularise the idea of
Software Reliability Engineer (SRE) said "SRE is what you get when you ask a
developer to design an Operations process."

To be honest, this entire book can be boiled down to "Software Literate companies is what you get when you ask a developer to design a company".

But lets just look at one (important) aspect of a company - *Project
Management*.  Fundamentally, work inside a company can be divided into
two parts - *running the company* and *changing (improving?) the
company*.

Running the company is just the day-to-day
business-as-usual processes.  Opening up the store, stocking the
shelves etc.  (and yes, very amenable to automation).

Changing the company is usually harder.  It is a search process usually, looking for product-market fit for early stage companies, or later stage companies loking for efficencies etc.

And CHanging the company is almost always coralled into *projects*.  As such automating project management will be very very helpful.

And as we are designgin a softweare literate company, we dhall desing a compny that is mostly automated, and driven by software - and as such changing the software means changing the company.

Lets repeat that - changing the codebase, means changing a company. And if changing the codebase is now project management, then project management should flow *from* gthe codebase.




Software Literate Project Management.
-------------------------------------

I am embarrassingly bad at traditional Project management.
Co-ordination, keeping an eye on the most important parts.  Basically
I assume that if i know something, then everyone else knows it too.
So there would be no point in telling other people about
it. Co-ordinating. for example.  Also my timekeeping sucks which tends
to piss everyone off eventually. (Such as the woman I left waiting at
the Cinema so long, the film actually finished before I got
there. There wasn't a second date.  Not sure why I am sharing, but you
get the idea. Manual project management is a skill I really want to
automate away.)

So what can a codebase do that is *better* than manual project managers?
Better than teams of "change specialists"?

Well, lets start with lying.  People lie. Everyone lies. If your
husband asks if this sweater makes him look fat round the middle, you
say "no darling".  If your boss' boss asks if the project is going to
be ready on time, you are *optimistic*.  You don't for example,
recommend a regieme of salads, beans and cutting out the chocolate
biscuits while running 2 miles a day.  You dont say the code base is
crap, the test coverage laughable and the specifications so vague we
still dont know what the goal is.

No, you lie. So your boss thinks its ok. And meerily everyone trundles along
kind of hoping everything will work out all right.

Whcih brings us to project management and risk management

Which brings us to Backlogs and True State of project

WHich brings us to tests, and velocity.


* everybody lies
* Capex and Opex, hidden Capex, slow code movement, spikes and inches.
* Software Option pricing
* Capturng cost data. Infrastructure as code.
* ticketing, scrum and agile, co-ordination, risk management.

Everyone hates agile

Software CapEx

- anecdotally loads of time money thrown away as people decide to rewrite or chnage minds
- this will be more carefully managed if it was clear from capex how much this costs

Software - intangible fixed assets
