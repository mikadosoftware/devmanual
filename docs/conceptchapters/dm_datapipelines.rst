PySpark to take huge data sets down to something small enough to fit in memory and pandas.  then pandas.  then visualisation tools - the simple enough stuff is Altair / Vega - but always have D3.JS as fallback for when you cannot find the right graph pre made

Adjust lib-report to hold visualisation library too
