The Golden Rule
--------------
Never promise anything to a customer until *after* it is pushed to master.

You can provide tracking estimates but never ever a promise.  Be clear on the difference and always PM by risk management - the happy path project manager is just a perk script 


Software Governance and Python / Guido
--------------------------------

So the lack of governance came to fore
Had to decide how to govern them selves
one option was a board of directors like arrangement (pep 8012)
But these were no pythonistas - now if they were a business then  the code made less of a impact on business (inverted pyramid) than wider business issues that the coders not in the weeds on - it's who is in the weeds makes decision about the weeds

it's why business / IT distinction works - because business people are in th weeds of business - and it's one thing that may have to chnage - but how does programmable company chnage the amount that can be modelled / relied upon ? how will person management chnage versus governance - will we need person management as much once we have democracy in a company?
