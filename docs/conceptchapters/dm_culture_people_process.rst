Culture People Process
======================

TBD

Don't do deadlines
------------------

We like Product management (What is the shared vision)
We like Risk management (what risks can we mitigate)
We even like project management (why are we off course)

A roadmap is a set of milestones to achieve, in a *given order*
Deadlines are not part of that roadmap - however estiamted time to arrive *is*.
From milestones one can estoamte arrival time.

However bad things happen when deadlines drive us.

Deadlines are the *worst* way to achieve an ordering.
Because it lacks consideration for all other tasks

At some point in the top of the org there should be a milestone ordering
system, that links to teams that links to their velocity.

Agile companies need agile project managmeent top to bottom.

So the change of ordering of the backlogs affects all items.

This is a rolling up effect - yes it can be complex, and yes reducing it to
"epics" that are "super epics" is poor.  But it is at least a glimplse of reality.  It gives you factors of sanity to work with.

The Golden Rule
--------------
Never promise anything to a customer until *after* it is pushed to master.

You can provide tracking estimates but never ever a promise.  Be clear on the difference and always PM by risk management - the happy path project manager is just a perk script 


Software Governance and Python / Guido
--------------------------------

So the lack of governance came to fore
Had to decide how to govern them selves
one option was a board of directors like arrangement (pep 8012)
But these were no pythonistas - now if they were a business then  the code made less of a impact on business (inverted pyramid) than wider business issues that the coders not in the weeds on - it's who is in the weeds makes decision about the weeds

it's why business / IT distinction works - because business people are in th weeds of business - and it's one thing that may have to chnage - but how does programmable company chnage the amount that can be modelled / relied upon ? how will person management chnage versus governance - will we need person management as much once we have democracy in a company?
