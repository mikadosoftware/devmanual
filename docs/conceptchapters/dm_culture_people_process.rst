Culture People Process
======================

TBD

Don't do deadlines
------------------

We like Product management (What is the shared vision)
We like Risk management (what risks can we mitigate)
We even like project management (why are we off course)

A roadmap is a set of milestones to achieve, in a *given order*
Deadlines are not part of that roadmap - however estiamted time to arrive *is*.
From milestones one can estoamte arrival time.

However bad things happen when deadlines drive us.

Deadlines are the *worst* way to achieve an ordering.
Because it lacks consideration for all other tasks

At some point in the top of the org there should be a milestone ordering
system, that links to teams that links to their velocity.

Agile companies need agile project managmeent top to bottom.

So the change of ordering of the backlogs affects all items.

This is a rolling up effect - yes it can be complex, and yes reducing it to
"epics" that are "super epics" is poor.  But it is at least a glimplse of reality.  It gives you factors of sanity to work with.

The Golden Rule
--------------
Never promise anything to a customer until *after* it is pushed to master.

You can provide tracking estimates but never ever a promise.  Be clear on the difference and always PM by risk management - the happy path project manager is just a perk script 


Software Governance and Python / Guido
--------------------------------

So the lack of governance came to fore
Had to decide how to govern them selves
one option was a board of directors like arrangement (pep 8012)
But these were no pythonistas - now if they were a business then  the code made less of a impact on business (inverted pyramid) than wider business issues that the coders not in the weeds on - it's who is in the weeds makes decision about the weeds

it's why business / IT distinction works - because business people are in th weeds of business - and it's one thing that may have to chnage - but how does programmable company chnage the amount that can be modelled / relied upon ? how will person management chnage versus governance - will we need person management as much once we have democracy in a company? 


Platforms, values and globalisation
------------------------------------

We see the push back against internal "values" and desire to remain neutral to take money

"what is the point in discussing values 


effectively businesses have always said  what their given audience wants to hear and hoped like hell the various different audiences do not listen.  but like politicians they are finding it is now much much easier for different audiences to hear the dissonance

and so we are seeing rose ofnpoliticoans that avoid the dossonce by taking unnuanced aggressive *simple* and most importantly consistent positions 

we should expect the same for businesses - and perhaps massive fracturing of brands (Avon owned Tiffany) 

Globalisation makes this talking to different audiences even harder - it used to be possible to have distinct geographical brands that happened to share the same name - from IBM innUSA having different approaches to That in Nazi germany.

Language will be the best way to hide, but even so there is a pressure for company brand values to influence which clients they use, 

Platforms : we need to see the rise of a new kind of class of business - we had publishers, and common carriers, but is there now a platform.  I don't think so but the main argument is look at gmail - they do filter my email for me based on rules.  But those rules are both mostly common, and mostly user configurable 

we are looking to demand something like : the minute you start selecting what to show 

gmail does not remove my access to my emails but it does present them in filters 

I think the filter bubble implies a different seduction process - the difference between contextual advertising and behavioural advertising

as such I think we have a line for difference between common carrier and publisher / platform 

the difference of applying individual rules ?? 

this has huge implications for AI/ML - mostly the need to explain the rules / decisions

email
search
timeline - this is where we are still working out details - and it almost certainly leads us to a *agent* based approach where the agent is working on our behalf to deliver a best experience - which implies that we stop being the product and start being the programmer - as why should Inrely on Facebook being the best agent for me to view facebook platform

and we come full circle - the walled gardens are looking unlikely to succeed. 

Facebook essentially is if you want to share your post with people not like you you need to pay - the behavioural filter is a pay wall ?
