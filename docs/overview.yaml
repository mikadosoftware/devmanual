a: Mis-en-place / Developer environment:
   - developer workstations, office requirements, in office etc. etc.

a: laptop builds / immutable workstation
  - immutable workstation

** coding standards - only what is enforced by linter etc.
  - we aim for iteratioin and discussion about code.
  - lots of discussion - written for preference.

** Team culture really really matters.
  - but a one year contract does not mean much.

* Version Control
** Branching Strategy (git.git, githubflow)
** Commit Message Guidelines
** Pull Request (PR) Process
** Resolving Merge Conflicts
** ticket driven or ticket breadcrumbs. (next obvious step)


* Performance and Optimization
** make it work, make it right, make it fast
** Profiling and Debugging Tools
** Monitoring and Observability (APM, Logs, Metrics)
** Performance Testing, E2E and other, as part of CiCD

* Release management
** Go/NoGo - automated fail points (security, performance)
** automated all the way
** Tools, audience management etc - a release process and checklist (SOPs)
 

* SDLC
** linting
** coverage
** security scanning
** unit testing
** whole org test rig
** No coding standards unless linter does it.
** DORA metrics
** punchclock
** discussions around code not ideas - one paragraph is enough to start
** linting
** static analysis https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
** isort
** explore vs exploit. Never be in position where the quick docs fix takes less

* documentation
** ReadTheDocs or equivalent
 

* SDLC - Operations, Incident Mgmt, Audience Mgmt
** SLAs SLOs - the SRE problem
** runbooks, autoamtion, how
** Statistical Process Control in Operations
** AI analysis of operations

* Testing and QA - a spectrum
** unittesting
** fuzzing
** at some point everything that can be auotamted out of the way should be done before you think.
** Whole Org Test rig

* Disaster recovery and Backup
** see 'build everything from scratch in docker on demand'

* Architecture, design etc
** C4 and contract design between C's
** enough design upfront.
 

* COnfiguration Mgmt, feature toggles and release mgmt
** etcd, what does "release to production" mean with toggles and config?
** a given config should be hashable so we have code hash plus config hash as stable
** nix is trying to get there.

* SDLC-CI/CD/Infrastructure (as code)
** Jenkins
** unit testing, test at IO boundaries,
** whole org test rig
** linting
** static analysis
** artifact mgmt
** monorepo vs microrepo
** build testing
** secrets (see vault etc)
** failfast,
** share deployment chunks - ie teams share jenkins snippets
** environment consistency
** metrics and reporting
** Uber and submitqueu
** cleaning up afterwarss matters

* monitoring and observability
** grafana
** openTelemetry
** reporting,
** pagerduty
** QA and testing as part of this
** logging and centralised logging and log monitoring and scanning
** business event capturing
** combine Nasa OpenMCT and OpenTelemetry
** see cloudflare use of open telemetry to return logging
** logging

* Homelab vs cloud
** Why do this at all - all you need is cloud account
** mininet
** containers and orchestration
** DNS
** TLS, CA, Certs,
** SPIFFE
** build complete stack from scratch in docker (docker compose

* Network
** CDN
** API Gateway and quotas
** HTTP Load Balancing
** DDOS protection (cloudflare)
** Firewall

* Security
** IAM
** Authentication
** Authorisation
** Accounting
** Zero trust
** HSM, client certs,
** WebAuthn, FIDO
** Certs, client certs,
** TLS is not good enough - chanell is not per request authentication
** appsec -> shehackspurple
** FIDO webauthn
** NIST and SSDF (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ssdf) and Executive Order (EO)
14114

** what does end 2 end mean? if regulator wants to see the message how to do
that?


* Storage
** NAS
** NFS
** SMB
** Backup
** Archive
** Recovery process

* SysAdmin
** local Logging
** network back haul logging
** secure logging
** log monitoring and analysis (promethues, event mgmt)
** event capture (logs, app events, business events) Prometheus
** distibuted config
** NTP
** Aime / md5 sum of binaries
** IDS ?

* Messaging
** Importance of workers and queues in almost everything
** RabbitMQ/celery/201
** workers and web services
** Autosys and distributed job management
** dependancy management
** git analysis tools



* Software Governance, Compliance, Democracy
** Trolley problem
** Mission, shareholder mission vs middle management
** Tactics operations strategy. See google and TPUS, vs Midway and aurcraft carriers. Strategy is politican level.  Operations is being disrupted
** evolving architecture - using fitness function (ie a code metric - SLOcs, cyclometeic complexiry, vulnerability measures, linting, (static)
** do not fall for Just-In-Time Agile - we will build the infrastructure when we
find a story to justify it - thats spedning too much time on waiting for
tactical stories to appear 

* Management Information Systems, project mgmt, risk mgmt, planning, budgets
** Metrics is all, unfiltered.
** MIS is not for managers.
** Risk mgmt is all, keep a risk log before a gantt chart
** Dashboards out of observability
** Management is the place for statisical process control.
** statistics and stuff
** one level up, 2(O) 100x bigger
** is there a max number of chnages one can make per day?
** Twitter - can you really fire 90% of the devs?


* Databases, data structures
** choices - Size 
** sqllite is *fine*, Postgres should be default, pandas is *fine*
** Use dask
** Hadoop vs Postgres vs everything else
** getting a S3-like storage service
** Other services (RDBMS), HADOOP

* PeopleWare
** ongoing training
**

* HR
** qd personnel records
