==================
The DevManual
==================

top level concerns
------------------

- CI/CD
- Infrastructure as code
  comtainers and orchestration
- monitoring and observability 
automate all the things
- SDLC, collaborationnworh MaPS
- security and IAM
  secrets mgmt
- compliance and software governance
- mamagemet information systems (next level up reprting)
   capacity planning and scaling
   cost mgmt, budgeting and improvement s
- SLAs SLOs SLEs
   incident mgmt

- testing and QA - a spectrum of testing in productio 
  performance optmisation
- disaster recovery and backup

- configuration mgmt etcd, ansible

- documentation



interesting questions
Do you need a load balancer?
- TLS certs and rotation?
- Horizontal scalability.
- HA/DR
- dev/stage/production + being able to test/stage your complete stack on demand.
- CI/CD integrations, tools like ArgoCD or Spinnaker
- Monitoring and/or alerting with Prometheus and Grafana
- Would you benefit from being able to deploy a lot of off the shelf software (lessay Elastic Search, or some random database, or a monitoring stack) via helm quickly/easily.
- "Ingress"/proxy.
- DNS integrations.
If you answer yes to many of tho

The plumbing list
-----------------

SMTP - use postmarkapp.com as sending out emails yourself now just gets you
banned.

LOgging - use centralised logging plus some audit friendly means preventing
corruption

authentication. I think webauthn, CA approaches. The only thing we can tust is
the maths


oauth

- logging, event capturing
- production monitoring and QA in production (spectrum)
- unit tests, mocking and stubbing, 
- teat rigs emvironemts
- config handling and environments
- security authentication authorisation access
FIDO / client certs etc
- queues and queueing theory
- runbooks, prod support 
- trade off between urgency and robustness (promtiong code and FFS) 
- use of dashboards
- business metrics growing out of / related to tech metrics
- 


Operational Support

HolmesGPT - AI that can try to knit together different parts of failing
errors and provide easier root cause analysis.  sorta LLMs to check error
codes.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41326039





mono repo / multi repo





Draw the rest of the f***ing Owl 

Twitter - can you really fire 90% of the devs?
What about all the other things that hurt at scale
3-4(O)

Scene: newsroom like his gorlmfrodsy
"write this down"
"i'm just carving the oencil"
"sharpening?"
"no carving, about to melt the metalnfor that little rubber holder in the end"

wait what? 


the devmanual is about everything 
needed for a software team to operate 
within a business or organisation,
everything *before* a line of code 
is written - the stuff every team 
needs or will benefit from, from 
CI/CD setup, review processes, etc




This is a book about filling in the missing gaps on how to 
be part of, setup, maintain, run, "self-manage" a software team / teams.
Its not about what programming language, its about how to deal with users, 
auditors, maangers, what is best practise and what is just theatre.

It flows from one point of view - the code is *everything*.
EaC - Everything As Code


What are the areas to work on?

* Infrastructure as code. vulnerability mgmt, red teams,
* SDLC
* SDLC interactions with business - feed into ticketing system
* case management systems
* Rules engines
* Data storage (elastic, RDBMS, hadoop, file system NAS)
* IAM
* CRM
* logging, error capture
* dashboarding, monitoring, escalation, prioritsation
* guiderails / controls / monitoring, escalation, golden source data,
* from golden source build models of company - whole org test rig
* regulatory and mgmt reporting
*



Dashboarding - you need some way of keeping eveerything in check.
Use RAG.  use RAG on RAG.

Forensics - if you dont act on errors now, you never will
infrastructure as code

CRM - customer relationship management - everything from notifying of
upgrades to demo days and feedback, netowrking, blogs and office hours.

Measuring productivity

Its hard. software is a creative acticity
even if the software is going to be used as a machine 
the building of a factory assembly line is 
front loaded into the factory cost. yet it is the most vital part of a factory
yet software is design a aseembly line everything




controls
automated check of state or other desirable situation and ability to
report and precent progress till actuon taken

compounts

security
- CA self hosted / lets encrypt?
- approval system
- 

test rigging
- feature files / 
- teat generation 
- mitmproxy style teating
- break at network ans system boundaries
less at the unit level.


management 
- budgets
- approval system (purchase orders)
- future modelling (spreadsheet onwards)
- record and publish meetings
- MIS systems - event logging reporting

project mgmt

I often find project managers and senior management wanting a “zipper” project - where some big brained architect predicts the future use cases and needs and can plan pulling together the teeth in 15 steps ahead

Which is of course rubbish - mostly it’s amazing if you can predict the next zip.

this is "next step or phase soace" projeft mgmt - what you can do next is defined by your previous choices - so improce optionality - make tools and platforms not topless or low code decisions 


Things shoukd be as simple as possiblenbutnnonsimpler
	

simplicity as a choice

A friend who was a photographer would explain
hownhe overcame his "imposter syndrome".
He has enormous amounts of "kit" (gear might be more photogenic)
but he just keeps one simple camera withbone lens
in thebcar - because he is capable of doing the big setup annie leobowotz stuff 
but he chooses simplicity most of thebtime

The devmanual is about simplicity as choice in being a software developer

this is not the guide to witing small bits of code aa a single developer

its a guide to writing large bodies of code as part of a larger 
usually corporate team(s)

throughout my career I have started or joined teams of people with a usually xorporate goal inmmind

often we thought we needed lots of kit - downloadongnhadoop and datalake setups
and this does matter - but its like lenses for my photogroaher friend - you can fo anhellmof anlong way with 
awk and cat and a but of thinking.

team started talking like a team

when we start talking like a team, when we have operations sorted
its all part of the same thing

its a devmanual - as simple as we can

Introduction
============

A 'DevManual' is the (usually barely understandable) documentation passed
to a new coder on thier first day, explaining "how we do things around here".

It *should* be comprehensive, it *should* explain *why* as well as *how.

It so often is not ...

But this is my attempt to provide a set of best practises, and guidelines.

If I could describe the idea in one line it is


All the component parts to running a software-literate, programmable company
with examples.


Walkthrough
-----------

0. Security
This is the most basic component. And it informs so much else
- HSM (phones and ubikeys)
- identity management on every request
- zero trust security
95% of the time security is doing the right thing well.  It's the
remaining 5% that is the hard costly trade offs.  We will come to
those later.
Use CAs for SSH 
Each docker build needs to trust various ssh clients 
see smallstep.com/blog/use-ssh-certificates

Use client certificates to handle web access
Use MFA to handle web access

Don't bother with passwords etc - ???
