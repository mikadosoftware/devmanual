project mgmt
- effectiveness of troops in battle 60-90 days to peak, 200 to trough
lindybeige

- so why not use that for team formation? 

Future
- Climate chnage
-- a war footing solution for the globe - like march of dimes

team based performance reviews - more useful more team focused

concepts from literacy's
-----------------------


- hairdryer with 3200 and 200 300 as increasing value
- gold silver bronze
- shared concepts (religion, bible, preachers)


Efficiencies firns
------------------

Way to scale is partnership with other small clients
See guardian of galaxy style approach
See OSS support networks
See gov tech 

It is likely we shall see newspaper like forms appearing - staff editors (who frame the taste of the code base) and staff writers who are both learning trade and being taught taste - and contributing writers who are stand alone for specialised services

still not a mesh but close


The whole thing 
----------------

>>> fix all the bugs that are upsetting customers and causing them to flee.

Well yes.  I am just posting that it is possible to take a top level metric and build a backlog that represents sensible solutions to that metric.

But you first need

- a top level metric (preferably that measures what will make or break your business)
- a way to determine what things *under your control* drive that metric.

But yes, the things you do in the trenches will probably not move the needle far.  That is for two reasons

- at some point the code base is so big that doing "one thing" won't make impact (i think this is around the 100k SLOC) level which is still fairly small

- and even if you can affect the whole code base, the code is at the bottom
of an inverted pyramid of "leverage to affect the business" - the CEO can chnage the business far far more be deciding to triple the price tomorrow than any bugs you fix.

But yes - in the end, if you have a working product right now the best thing to do is to go
find real customers, work out why they are upset (either with clever telemetry analysis or just *fricking ask*) and go fix that bug / missing feature.

If you don't have a working product there is no telemetry so ... *fricking ask*.

But find what's not working and fix it is a good plan.  If what's not working however is "the business model" we are in interesting territory

I think a non working business model
is *exactly* the purview of software.  I think that we shall
replace all non-coding business people
with coders who can business in a generation.  But that this generation will see real opportunities


- There is a business / coding divide
- there is a leverage of impact pyramid (inverted)
- but "business" is a small skill set (politics is not, sales is not - business is) 
- so it's easier to teach business to coders than vice versa

- bad business model is a eric ties style lean question - and searching is what software does well - somprogram the search 

marketers being replaced by software like was for warehouse workers - a modern marketeer is bit like i was picking and packing - just human doing a robots job.
