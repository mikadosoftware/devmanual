A major unseen problem is reduction in written down discussion

cf linux mailing lists

parliamentary style 

see agile - where proxies for expertise and authority will dominate as there is less "writing stuff down to discuss it" in favour of mythical "talk and do - face to face is better"

turns out talking with customers is better and puttingnthings in front of them quickly is even better
