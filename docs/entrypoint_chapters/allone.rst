I did have the whole internet printing press thing going.
But we need to look deeper

- new economics becoming clearer - the neo-liberal consensus seems agonisingly wrong in Africa and just misguided post 2008
- 

- biggest idea is the iPhone. We just are not seeing the productivity gains we expect forom the Internet. It is hard to credit that it is a bubble the whole world has bought. We are nearly at a stage where every adult human has online access of some form.  That matters deeply

What we are missing is the re-organisation of the factory similar to that of electrification

I argue that we are seeing three trends coming together

- coaseian ideal firm size is shrinking. Look at Bank of America/google.  Challenger banks etc. Yes vast scale matters - but at a certain point all business transactions are entries in a shared ledger. Remind you of something.


I don't think we are there yet. Ledger technologies don't scale to the level we care about punlically. But internally we are there.  But so was email before internet - the big win for electrification was the dynamo. 

- faster feedback on customer likes - wants in tech firms. Killing lions, cutting through beiraicy (end of project managers) 
- most projects are co-ordination - but code is self co-ordinating - programmable company is a non-project company

A programmable company is one where the current decisions are encoded in software

So let's imagine we take a decision on a project - this must mean a chnage to something (else it's a rubbish decision) so we record 

- what was decided
- why it was decided
- how to judge its success

This is a series of commits / changes across the base - from change to monitoring system to commits on the codebase 


Summary

If you are not coding, start
If you are not replacing whole projects with code that checks if other code is doing what it's supposed to, do that
If you are not migrating to a serverless, run anywhere model (with server-led for some highly optimised areas) do that
If you are not using crypto-signed ledgers everywheee internally do that
If your companies actions, reactions and decisions are not in code, do that
If you cannot do what if analysis on your company's defining code, do that




Steam factories and the rise of electricity
Steam factories ran to a central Rythmn, a single shaft ran from the vast engine across the factory floor and cranks attached to it. Everyone worked to the engines ryhtmn, physically located along the shaft

Toyota quality cicrcle simply could not be invented.
