The Software Mind
=================

The transition from pre-SoftwareLiteracy organisations to post software literacy



Introduction
============

.. epigraph:: Pages he (P.G. Wodehouse) felt were working well would be pinned up high, and those that still needed work would be lower down the wall. His aim was to get the entire manuscript up to the picture rail before he handed it in


I have been building software professionally for almost
20 years, (it only *feels* longer) and recently was asked by a
young, up-and-coming start-up to act as their *technical advisory board*.  They
had their vision for the company, they had the drive and the gumption,
but lacked technical *understanding*; it is a complicated
world out there with every other blog giving their must-have-advice on their
pet corner of the technology world.

These guys wanted someone to make sense of all the conflicting advice and draw a
convincing map from where they are now, to where technology can contribute
meaningfully to their business.

I hope I did (and continue to do) a good job.  But it was surprisingly
difficult.  Oh saying "You need to build an automated CI process", was easy. How
to put one together from any number of excellent packages is quick.

But the hardest part was not *what* or *how*.  The hardest part was *why*.

Why should you use the current best practise technique?  Err, because
it is the best practise is kind of an answer, but quite unsatisfactory.  Why
demands, context, it demands history and understanding.

But why is vital to being free to make your own *next* choice.  Unless
you are to be wedded to your technical advisor, you need to see the
world the way I see it.  And then you can make your own choice, but
with the point of view of a 20 year software veteran.


So it's the two kinds of why - why this move instead of all the other moves possible. That means you need an understanding of all the possible moves and their future implications - why means a map. (See swardley)


And so this book was born.  It is both an attempt to clearly show the
state of the art in building software in the 21 Century, but it is
also an attempt to understand why the art looks the way it does.

This book is partly history lesson, partly diatribe on the software industry and
mostly an attempt to download my point of view into your head.  Don't worry - I
have very little in my brain these days so it won't hurt.  Ready?

Software literacy 
=================


Pre- and Post-literate society 
==============================


Programmatic company
====================

Quality is hard - needs a strong engineering culture
A post literate culture

Politics is software, software is law
======================================
Harmonisation, immigration, globalisation
Like lawyers
Policy is imprinted in software. Just as in law
Weapons of math destruction and public policy Pre-literacy

What choices do we need to make as society in public policy - open accountable transparent flexible / configurable


Global politics - whilst the big shocks recently have been towards
anti-immigration and protectionist (brexi, trump etc) but this year the heads of
50 african governments agreed a free labour movement area, as did asia.  So 2
billion people are movong in the direction of global free trades.

as I will argue the benefits of global trade in goods is generally well
established and people are reluctant to give it up.  Thats not a complete given
but ...

And the hidden nature of "harmonistation" makes it harder to see beenfots but it
is in technology that harmonisation is most natural and most difficult to get
around.


The 
For some reason about 100,000 years ago, a smallish ape living in Kenya, Africa
started to spread North and East, working together in family groups or small
tribes against the cold and the night.

Science is to all intents and purposes the culmination of that process.

Science is struggling with crowd behaviour
Organising ourselves is of paramount importance
Democracy is a fairly new thing (about forty years)
Globalisation is huge force - like having your iPhone work in different countries?
Uber is a form of regulatory harmonisation

So how will we organise companies

Programmatic company leads to roald chase shrinking size which leads to more manageable org sizes which leads to more ability absorb change which leads to more radical change which has been problem for thirty years and issue around brexit

* programmable corporation, prgrammable live
Programmatic company - transparent processes, transparent metrics available to all and


Perhaps another way to look at it - if you can read the precise instructions on how to build a company, or a house, you can make changes to the house - if you can automrebuild it you can easily improve it

If not you are just left with sticking stuff on the sides.  A near perfect metaphor for a bureaucratic only able to metastasise not evolve or improve

Sompreviously the metrics were only available as you went up hierarchy
Now it's a matter of policy

* productivity
  There are several counter headwinds to western economic growth (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691147728)

  - productivity as the engine of growth held back by
  - demographics
  - inequality
  - debt (1/4 of Debt is student debt in USA)
  - dropping education

  Producity should be high - look at Kasparov and AI / centaur
  But lack of software literacy is holding individuals back and lack of coaseian-optimal organisation sizes hold back organisational productivity


* end of privacy

Privacy as a matter of policy
Hard to enforce
Secrecy is gone too


* software literacy
Fundamental force


* stoneage minds, science and rationality and economic behaviour


* estimation, prediction, relaxing and reviewing
  Summerhill school

Major trends
------------

- distributed by default. This works for data, and processing.  But
  for organisations too - conways law.

- chips everywhere (inverse mores law), privacy pollution problem

- Software Estimation
  You can't plan out each step in your
  journey You can't change your destination in between each step

- Science is measurement. Engineering is applied science. Metrics
  everywhere.

- the world at large (politics gets everywhere, and as software
  programs the world, politics and software will meet. New forms of
  governance (Debian)

- containers, IOT needs updates and ntp servers

Modern trends
-------------

new corporation
Corporations as machines: we build machines to benefit us - we tend to them.



Privacy issues

Not so modern people
--------------------

Disfluency
----------
- nee time to learn as well as data.
- need to do it by hand
- need to learn

Why is software so diverse ?

Not age, sex or race. That's a whole 'nother problem.  But the
practises are diverse.  The US Presidential election of 1896 was a
turning point in US politics. (** Relate to modern elections) But it
marked the end of a hugely turbulent period of change in Western world
and business practises. Electricity is a great example. Factories were
redesigning - took another twenty years. Best practises emerged and
final result was ford.

Google is not ford. Ford is the programmable company.

This book is a walk around the software factories of today, and an
attempt to understand what the first programmable company will look
like.

Ford's not ideal (1937 battle of the overpass). In many ways the
battles of UK in 19C were reflected in early 20th, culminating in
business coup referenced by Gen Smedley X

The goal here is the programmable company. Like ford it is an
inflection point. One. It reached yet.

But it is worth exploring Most software teams develop and release
software in their own way.  Like factories that have not yet settled
on best practise.  Agile is not it. Trust me



Why - because we are re-inventing our factories We could have industry
standard operating procedures for vast majority of companies. We
could - but we don't.

But most of problems of software in house I have seen is not
developers with timenonntheir hands still unable to meet business
needs, mostly it is two things

- inability to articulate what is needed for business to succeed
- the whole other crap that swamps is all


esprit de corps
---------------
Teams matter waaaay more than individual contributors

No one likes being told what to do.  So let developers contribute
their next best step.

Discuss planning carefully, have wide open discussions on next step.
Lieutenants own chunks of code. Use Linux development model

At the beginning of greenfield almost any code laid down is 10x. Don't
believe in 10x myth.  Iceland and Wales versus England.  Esprit de
corp

"""The what-to-build skill trumps the how-to-build-it skill every time!"""

So the essence of software org is loads of discussion on what to build - discussion is good example of open source approach?

The corollary to thisnis you can't hire a 10x developer and then tell them what to do. Which is a revelation for allmiddle management. And the design of lost organisations
Basically you are hiring intraprenuers



Social organisation, commit bits, licenses and future income and
reputation.



Start with the Dashboard
------------------------

This gives us a simple means to always show we have a feedback loop
and always remain in control.  It is also the simplest means to show
what is provided for the end user.


The New CTO Dashboard
---------------------

Every software team (whether one person or a hundred) has multiple
streams of work they must do to keep their software

I am including "operations" as part of this as most software teams do
this - either directly ala Facebook / Amazon or indirectly ala third
line support.

These streams are

- producing new features
- maintaining high code quality
- operational performance and metrics
- bug fixing
- tech debt
- marketing
- servicing users





For every software organisation we can define a set of capabilities,
and for each capability we can define best practise and then rate our
own organisation against the best practise.  This can give a clear
idea where to focus improvement efforts.

Team capabilities
-----------------

-

- micro-services architecture



Organisation capabilities
-------------------------

- flexible cell structure ?

Business capabilities
---------------------

- programmable corporation


- Deploy
- Develop
- Release
- monitor
- operations (SOP)
- security
- service levels (SLA)
- ticket requests
- architecture / distributed data
- programmable corporation
- adjusting business model
- marketing
- disaster recovery / option pricing
- learning and training and teamwork
- stakeholder engagement
- project management: new agile

New agile
https://medium.com/@gabrielgambetta/how-i-wrote-my-first-novel-during-my-daily-commute-e1d02c9447b9#.248qy79fb

Good description of process - 80 "scenes" - we must must have a storyboard - think the sticky notes
Always have storyboard
Always have interactions between stories
Stories are states???

But always always - must be clear must be shared

Technical Capabilities
----------------------

* Measure Lines Spent
  Edgar Djyskstra quote - tech debt
  The more code written the more there is to understand
  Writing lots of code, writing it quickly, is often the contractor curse - too much too soon. There is no such thing as hitting the ground running.

* measure Onboarding times

* measure code quality not feature velocity

* measure effort to deploy

* measure inter dependancy

* measure metrics - is code well
Measured in production

* web logging good enough practise

- generate a unique ID per request, pass it through all stages

amatix 2 hours ago [-]

For us, a `X-Request-ID` header is generated by any app if it doesn't receive it from upstream -- but normally nginx or the CDN will generate it. There's a few nginx modules to do it, we use https://github.com/newobj/nginx-x-rid-header
Most languages/logging frameworks have some sort of per-thread context (eg. Filters in Python, MDC in log4j, etc) to be able to tag log messages with. If you're using postgresql, you can call `SET application_name='{requestID}';` and that can be output as part of logs too.

* Deployment can deploy code through promotion of fixed "builds" into
  production using totally automated means.

* micro services architecture This is a major issue. Includes
  security, service discovery messaging logging and pr nose to only go
  through front door. See stevey blog post.
  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12133670
  Use fluentd logging
https://blog.treasuredata.com/blog/2016/08/03/distributed-logging-architecture-in-the-container-era/

* OS installation and Hardening Choice of OS, location Ansible or
  similar automation scripts

* Kerberos and Authentication Authentication and Authorisation are
  vital capabilities and federated, distributed security have so many
  advantages (think uUId as primary key )

* Build promotion and use of containers PyHolodeck

* message queues and worker pools Messaging Job scheduling based on
  events and then queues Is a resource problem always

* performance monitoring metrics gathering with graphite

* unit testing, integration testing, perfromance testing

* user acceptanbce tests and UI tests Automated testing is vital and
  we must put huge amounts of effort into it simply to make the next
  release

* continuous integrations and delivery There is no point batching up
  changes to go on a time based schedule. Code is ready as it is
  written and the decision to release should be based on automated
  tests. Only marketing or other business decisions should delay - so
  always push to pre-prod

* pre-prod is live-clone

* replaying actual traffic

* Reporting
  Simple reports

* SOPs and checklists

* Measuring metrics

* documentation

* Dev Ops

* statistics

* distributed data and computation
  Use of Apache spark, Hadoop etc

Project mgmt
------------

We all work on projects of some form or other.  Tools will help us.
Working for an enterprise, they want different reporting approaches.
So the simplest answer is to have a buffer - write and read to and
from

Tickets in a parent child chain A child can have many parents (?)  Git
based bugs?  Functional specs that map easily to tickets (spec2ticket)
Unless you write down explicitly what you are trying to achieve, and
discuss it with the developers and business owners, you end up with
three things - some people who don't understand most of it and just go
along hoping to pick it up later, some people who think they
understand it but have forgotten some vital and really hard parts and
think this is going to be easy, and some people who think they are
building something not quite the same shape as everyone else.

The mark of a high functioning team is how quickly new hires get up to
speed - you don't need Einstein to come in if you kept it simple and
well tested and well API'd.

We are aiming for a level of security that is good but not awesome.

high - we protect against threats with high external component and
lower internal.

Internal is best to use a lot lot of audit

Best Practises, Open Source
---------------------------
My best practises Open Source Project

Guest blogs in Rackspace etc
Focus on open stack deployment


So like many others Inhave a sprinkling of Open Source projects,
ranging from fairly full featured to a good idea and two hours typing.
But OSS is not simply the place to practise ones actual coding
skills - but it could be a place to home the skills and approaches
needed around the actual work.
- death of middle management

So this is my *exemplar* project - how I would run a commercial providing-food-for-the-kids project if I had the managerial space - and perhaps with my own company I shall

1. source control
2. tech debt and tech assets - code and tests
3. requirements lifecycle (PEP)
4. automated build and deployment (dogfood)
5. Documentation and Marketing
6. openness and reviews
7. Progress Not Perfection (YouTube clip)
8. static and other analysis
9. performance mgmt and measuring everything (and making reports on everything)
10. Automatic project mgmt
11. Risk management
12. have fun, try new things, don't be afraid

Sustainable Open Source
I am by no means a prolific OSS contributor, and my contributions are sometimes of poorer quality than I wish.  This is the conflict between the inner project manager and the inner software developer.

Let's look at a discussion in clean Coder by uncle Bob - (ref)
Here there is an ideal professional developer and an ideal professional PM who when one says they cannot the other accepts.  My problem is that for a lot of jobs and times, one is expected to act as the projects PM and the lead Dev. In which case you have two personalities inside you - and the PM one is socially seen as the professional correct one (hit this arbitrary deadline) but the Dev is crippled by social pressure we all have inside ourselves - the idea that maybe perhaps we could do that deadline

- need to please


Instead we could have red lines:

Automated testing and coverage
Strategic decisions - well they are strategic (cannot be hedged away by tactical work like automated tests)

Can we see tests as risk hedging.  So is this about risk mgmt?

Software risk mgmt :

Hedging and option pricing

Of course - retainers are option premiums !
So how should they be priced ?


Because the values of option contracts depend on a number of different variables in addition to the value of the underlying asset, they are complex to value. There are many pricing models in use, although all essentially incorporate the concepts of rational pricing, moneyness, option time value and put-call parity.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model#Method


Source Control
seriously, just use git but githubfkow
rewrite as much as you like until you publish
commit public ally with a description in the commit, bugid is not enough.  explain why to the reviewer - put the detail in the commit message (see no project management)

tech debt - writing code introduces more complexity and bugs.  it is debt. even well written code is debt.  Responsibly lent mortgage debt but still debt.  badly written poorly tested code is payday lender style debt.

assets are the opposite of debt - tests are the opposite of code.  tests tell you code is like well invested debts, debts you know went on sensible things.

Contract testing - like testing the type of parameters and returns - aka Eiffel

3. Requirements lifecycle.  oh yes. oh yes. seriously the amount of money major enterprises throw into projects with poorly formed, badly if at all written requirements that are promptly not read by anyone involved is - well it's a lot let me tell you sonny Jim.

so part of the no project mama gents process is to actually have requirements, you know, written down, discussed, thought about and tried out.

these are of course miniature projects in themselves.

Trust in people to challenge why others are doing something.


4. automated build and deployment
for an automated build and deployment project this is pretty obvious

5. docs and marketing
docs are vital.  screencasts it seems are just as vital.
however marketing is begun there but not ends there. forums.
being an all round good egg

6. openness and reviews

7. progress not perfection
I have a massive discuss next between what is reasonably possible for a average to good developer (me) to be able to achieve in two or three days at work (with interruptions) and what I *could* do if I had got plenty of rest, drunk my Orange Juice, refactored code on this area just last week and ... well, I think I *could* do more than I have.  but this leads me to think I should have done more - and that tends to lead to outrageously negative defensiveness, including rushing and cutting corners to get it done in the arbitrary self imposed deadline, or perhaps worse, lying about how far I have got and saying "just another day" (often lying to myself first)

https://basildoncoder.com/blog/pg-wodehouse-method-of-refactoring.html

8. static analysis

9. Performance analysis

10. Automatic project mgmt.  not tasks. milestones.  not manually approved milestones, automated tests that validate milestone.  and requirements analysis


11. Waltzing with bears

12. have fun.

List of topics to cover
=======================

Simple to complex roadmaps
--------------------------

One of the important things in software, perhaps the most important, is to keep things simple.
As the needs of an organisation grow, the complexity of the systems it uses increases.
I show here, in each section, a roadmap of complexity.  The base simplicity levels are
expected to give the fundamental understanding of the problems, but give way fgracefully to
new, (ope source) solutions that do the same thing as the simple system, but have extra more useful features.

FOr example, in configuration and co-ordination, we start with just a init file style API that reads from a text file
telling us what config data exists for our systems.  This is *fine* but it really quickly hits limits.
SOmething like APache Zookeeper is the next logical step, but that is waay more complicated to set up.
So we start witht he simplest possible, and point to where to take the next steps.


Automated provisioning
----------------------

- Ansible vs salt vs bash
  Look, bash is just *fine*
  We could use fabric for everything if we wanted.
  Now fabric supports parallel execution, there is limited need for other solutions
  I will use salt for basic infrastructure buildouts, its integreation with AWS etc.
  and then use fabirc once we have managed the state of PKI / servers up and pinabgle.
  This may be too complex but it is at least clear.

  Use fabric to build basic modules that ansible runs

  ::

     pip install ansible

- pyholodeck
- holoconfig


Personal Security
-----------------

- QubeOS

- iOS - libimobiledevice

http://2014.zeronights.org/assets/files/slides/belenko.pdf


- Personal Password management

  Use Password Safe, on iOS and on linux.
  Keep the safe file in sync via dropbox
  I need to : install pwsafe, dropbox on laptop and iOS, configure synching
  https://github.com/ronys/pypwsafe


- ssh-agent
  how toconfigure

- Run own CA

  Use client and server certificates to ensure comms secure.

-  eCryptfs


PKIs
----

The oprginasiuation needs to use PKI

It can use SSH public keys to allow comms between a user and servers over SSH
It needs to use SSL client certificates to allow commms between user and web servers (apps)
It can also use SAML to intermediate beween those
It will need another solution for server-server comms


Server Security
---------------

- unikernels and cloud deployments
  The obvious end point of docker and immutable servers
   http://erlangonxen.org/blog/rediscovering-cloud
   Can we rely on the library is?

- qubeos

- security models and PKI

- saml and single sign on multiple providers
  A sensible approach is client certs
  That won't happen with passwords so ...

- ssh


Standard Operating procedures are of course neccessary
They make up a user manula for my company, Mikado software.

Using GitHub / ssh
------------------

::

    $ ssh-keygen
    choose no passphrase,
    save in home/pbrian/.ssh/github

    Your identification has been saved in /home/pbrian/.ssh/github.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/pbrian/.ssh/github.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    a8:81:d2:77:ef:5e:36:e0:8d:74:8e:3e:bd:38:33:7d pbrian@HPCube


Lets test to see if we have github access (ie they got our *public* key)

::

    $ ~/projects$ ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/github git@github.com
    Hi lifeisstillgood! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

But thats a mouthful to run each time



Now we update our .ssh/config

::


    $ cat ~/.ssh/config

Meta Projects
=============

I have lots, perhaps too many, ideas. And I hate to let go of any of them.
This means most are unfinished and thus the really high potential ones do not get as much attention as they should.

I know I will benefit from more focus, but i also benefit from "a change is as good as a rest".  So I want a means to keep my projects in control, without overwhlming my ability to remeber what they are all.

I need a kind of software "Getting Things Done".


My project control will be

* stored in individual repos remotely (ie on github)
* secure enough
* lightweight
* easilyexpansible
* easy to publish information about them


BOS Projects
------------

Business Operating System Projects - what features / capabilities do I want that are simple, expansiable, unix-like and much more business orientated?

1. Report-setting
2. Purchase Orider mgtm
3. contact mgmt
4. address book
5.


Business Administration
=======================

If you are responsible for a team of one or more (!)
you should do these, even if it's not a legal entity
you are leading.  However if it's your own company -
You definitely need to do these

*. Data room
   Storage of all legal and administrative contracts
   I have simple email system, drop box also work

*. Monthly Board pack
   You need this - writing is natures way of showing us how poor our thinking is.

*. Accounts


Universal basic income - the basic argument
-------------------------------------------

We do not charge for access to air, but we do for access to water and to food
Why?

DevOps has a cost
-----------------
Infrastructure costs to maintain
Releasing fifty times a day is great, as long as people are there making sure the servers are working
You cannot be super productive developer and maintain your servers

Pay the cost - it's not free
Churn of developers will hurt
Keep it documented and clean

Deep learning and AI
--------------------

Google chief economist Hal Varian calls this “computer kaizen.” For “just as mass production changed the way products were assembled and continuous improvement changed how manufacturing was done,” he says, “so continuous [and often automatic] experimentation will improve the way we optimize business processes in our organizations.”4


Hope and optimism
-----------------

Computer algorithms offer us hope - in a world where 190 countries are unlikely to agree on water being wet, distributed algorithms (paxos?) can teach us how to conorsinatr chnage.  What we will learn in organising our companies in democratic lines will feed into our societies.  War is always bad for business,

Money creation in modern economy boe


Fractional lending - banks create money
Idea is they de create it when loan repaid
But when market crashes and defaults occur, the value is gone but the cash ... still exists

So we are each crash increaibgnmoney supply
And what where synthetic CDOs creates to do - to absorb the excess cash that people wanted to invest

Shadow courts: global trade is being redefined and software (IP) is at heart of it
iPhone is one global standard and no one is going to challenge it


Wider world
- potential for an egalitarian and networked future, with common standards and common interests driving our societies and economies forward towards a golden future

Of course it can all fail to be that.  But this ideal (referred to as 45 degree politics, incorporating the bottom up horizontal community politics alongside the state and party infrastructure that can sustain politics beyond the passion of Election Day) is worth looking for in our work organisations as well

"having a strong engineering culture is much larger force multiplier"

 People write a lot about how things like using fancier languages or techniques like TDD or agile will make your teams more productive, but having a strong engineering culture is much larger force multiplier

 Fundamental problem:
 How to reward the person who arrives a day late because they steered around the storm
 And not reward the fool who risked his ship sailing through the storm

 Land how to reward the person who achieved the goal with a tenth of the effort
 And not reward the person who did the same thing but at ten times the cost - because big pr he te with  it budgets get high cosibility

Pre and post literate enterprises

Management coding
-----------------

I stepped away from manabgemt (pull me back in)
But as an example, a grid has been hardcoded, all over the place and is now getting retired. And we left it late.

Some teams did sensible CONSTANT use and have ten minutes testing. Others not so much.

It's a pretty trivial problem but it needs co-ordination and chasing and guess what that's a management job

So I write something - basically grep over the source tree. And then put it on a website and I need to assign the fixes for each team to the right team (who have to test it themselves) and basically chase and cajole

It's all automateable - effectively it's a set of todos that are outsourced.

It's a programmable company ??? Or over management? Icing from

The grain of the Internet
=========================
Public policy issues:
Weapons of math destruction is actively harmful algorithms
Internet of shit is the passively harmful technology - where open devices or crap software (see my car)

We need to find a path between interventionism and free market

This is a fundamental dividing line something about order and chaos and is very evident in American politics

It's hard to discern the dividing lines of Chinese and Indian politics today (look up?)



Washington post illiteracy
Plus
All those choices made badly - and that's just in getting software out, let alone choosing against the grain of the Internet

It ha sa grain

Open
Transparent
Root owns it
