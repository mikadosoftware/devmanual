Abstractions at business level (TV Questions)
=============================================

I'm a fan of "tech". I think most problems can be solved with more code.

But for 99% of businesses the important questions to them are not code.
Anymore than the important questions to them are reading and writing.

Netflix is on the surface a "tech" company - they invented the idea of 'choas
monkey' testing they release OSS code on a frequent basis, they run servers in
dozens of companies.  But the important issues to their success as a business 
are not how well are their servers running, but which TV show will get 14-24
year olds streaming like its 1999.  Questions like which films will be a hit and
which ones are not worth spending gazillions of dollars on (hint any Xmas film
with The Rock dressed as an elf) 

THis is a long winded way of saying every business exists in a niche, is fitted
to that niche in the way Darwin intended.  And so this niche, this domain, is
the way the software needs to be discussed.

The function names should reflect the jargon in the business, the metrics
measured should be related to the needs of the business.

We were once called Analyst Programmers.  This meant we needed to Analyse the
problem before programming a solution.  We needed to understand the domain in
which we work, as much as we understand the idioms of our coding language.

It is important to build opinionated software - and to do that, we need to have
opinions on the domain we are building software for.  Informed opinions work
best.
