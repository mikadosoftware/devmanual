Full Stack - everything needed
-------------------------------

Firstly we are looking at languages 
Sticking with Python for almost everything
fallback to elixir / erlang for reliable 
mass stacks and then message queues for backend work 

AI / LLMs are growing and there is a lot 
tomcomsider but the basics are LLMs are great at 
generating small well
defined patches of code especially in areas where 
code quality and human understandimg is not vital - 
so keep away from core competancies

So marketing automation is really useful 
but rarely a core competwncy - if you can use LLMs
to scan the omline wateringnholes of your target markets 
and then genrate adverts / landing pages and giveaways
to get people into your funnel, great. 

thats is a competwnt activoty for any business
and only when that competwnce meeds himan expertese do we need humans on it

Web UI and APIs
securoty - PKI first off (compare PKI yo kerberos)
message broker (rabbitMQ / kafka - messages for action vs events have occured like a log)
small
services
how to track a workflow through 
(centralmworkflow tegistry)
how to track a report / investigatuo. 
how to measure Statistical process control of workflows 
(central registry)
how to measure if things on fire (metrics, prometheus)

MIS as a first class activoty
(Deming vs drucker and MIS)
