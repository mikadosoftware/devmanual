Full Stack - everything needed
-------------------------------


How mucj invisible work software teams carry
this os because software loteracy 

Firstly we are looking at languages 
Sticking with Python for almost everything
fallback to elixir / erlang for reliable 
mass stacks and then message queues for backend work 

AI / LLMs are growing and there is a lot 
tomcomsider but the basics are LLMs are great at 
generating small well
defined patches of code especially in areas where 
code quality and human understandimg is not vital - 
so keep away from core competancies

So marketing automation is really useful 
but rarely a core competwncy - if you can use LLMs
to scan the omline wateringnholes of your target markets 
and then genrate adverts / landing pages and giveaways
to get people into your funnel, great. 

thats is a competwnt activoty for any business
and only when that competwnce meeds himan expertese do we need humans on it

stack
-----
Python / Erlang (Rust for Cython)
Web UI and APIs
securoty - PKI first off (compare PKI yo kerberos)
message broker (rabbitMQ / kafka - messages for action vs events have occured like a log)
small
services
how to track a workflow through 
(centralmworkflow tegistry)
how to track a report / investigatuo. 
how to measure Statistical process control of workflows 
(central registry)
how to measure if things on fire (metrics, prometheus)

MIS as a first class activoty
(Deming vs drucker and MIS)




Ohhh, this is a great premise for a book 😄
A “one team does everything” view is actually the clearest way to show how much invisible work software teams carry.

I’ll structure this as major domains, then sub-areas inside each. Think of these as chapters or sections you could later expand with war stories, anti-patterns, and checklists.

How this works beautifully for a book

You could:
	•	Frame each area as “What people think this is” vs “What it actually involves”
	•	Show failure modes when a single team owns everything
	•	Track maturity stages (startup → scale-up → enterprise)
	•	Use a fictional company and let the team slowly drown 😅

If you want, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a chapter outline
	•	Map roles vs responsibilities
	•	Highlight what usually gets ignored
	•	Or help you find a killer name for the book

Just say the word.
