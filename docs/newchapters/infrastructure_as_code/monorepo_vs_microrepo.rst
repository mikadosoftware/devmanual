monorepo vs microrepo
=====================

Homestly this is a non-issue

sure i can chnage things across 
many repos and its more awkward than in 
one repo

but when get to size how do you ensure what you are working against does not chnahe - which version am i working agaisnt - thatbis depenancy problem and at some point the depenancy choices are ours 

does mean always telease cersion with git hash innthem
