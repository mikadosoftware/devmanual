My goal for Jan 2017 is to *unify and streamline* my vast publishing empire.

I will work on the following project *themes* ongoing

* The Software Mind Book
* Campaign for OSS in Government
* Building a business to sustain my family's future.
* improving myself and my relationships

Which all seems nice.

Publishing Empire
-----------------

I have a lot of written words dotted around.
I will bring them all under one roof, suitably laying 302 trails for Google.
