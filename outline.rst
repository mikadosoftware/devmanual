Why full stack matters, and why you cant do it all
---------------------------------------------------




* Project Management
  history of Agile and scrum
  Critique of Agile / SCrum
     " You dont have to sprint if you are making seven-league boots"
  Essential project management
  Tight co-ordination with team members
  Mostly the same capabilities - but teamwork, transfer of trust.
  Read that book quoted by Clinton Roshenm

* Specfication discovery
  Working with users
  See service lifecycle - whats the User Need?

  Gov.uk service manaual
  SOA
  history of SOA in Amazon

* Managing tickets and commits
  Use of source cntrol
  Use of ticketing system

* specifications, design and tickets
  Must do upfront design.
  Design / discussion documents are vital and allow clarification
  Call this Architecture if you like, but dont assume people understand

* Everything is a service
  So services have Interface Points and lifecycles.

* OS installation and Hardening

* Kerberos and Authentication

* Web of trust
  Likely changes to "master password/account" - gmail will ask postoffice to approve password changes.
  Use the gov.uk auithentication (verify.gov.uk) scheme to change passwords?

* Sign up with verify.gov.uk providers

* Ansible based build scripts

* Maturity and keeping on a single course

* Work harder on fewer projects and polish them to be CV-worthy
  shipping working software

* Message Queue

* Business Intelligence reporting

Project mgmt
------------

We all work on projects of some form or other.  Tools will help us.
Working for an enterprise, they want different reporting approaches.
So the simplest answer is to have a buffer - write and read to and from

Tickets in a parent child chain
A child can have many parents (?)
Git based bugs?
Functional specs that map easily to tickets (spec2ticket)
Unless you write down explicitly what you are trying to achieve, and discuss it with the developers and business owners, you end up with three things - some people who don't understand most of it and just go along hoping to pick it up later, some people who think they understand it but have forgotten some vital and really hard parts and think this is going to be easy, and some people who think they are building something not quite the same shape as everyone else.

The mark of a high functioning team is how quickly new hires get up to speed - you don't need Einstein to come in if you kept it simple and well tested and well API'd.

Discover, write up and do OSS projects on
Scale up to 1000 cloud instances with full deployment and development and monitoring process

Server to server authentication


"Full on Full Stack"

What does it really take to be a full stack developer?

-


Intelligence gathering :
- economy model etc

Security as a baked in goal

We are aiming for a level of security that is good but not awesome.

This is where the internal threat is minimal  and external threat is high - we protect against threats with high external component and lower internal.

Internal is best to use a lot lot of audit

- server to server authentication
