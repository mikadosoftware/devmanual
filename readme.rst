Dev Manual
----------

This is the source point for a book / info-product titled "FullOnFullStack".

The goal is three-fold

* to create a repository for all my knowledge of development best practises,
  managing software teams and the "how-to" for a full-stack developer.

* to create a book / info-product that reflects the same repository

* to create the marketing around selling such a book.

There are three expected benefits:

* In my work as a contract developer, "keeping up" is hard, and this provides
   a focus for doing so *and* demonstrating.

* It also provides a simple means to demonstrate my chops to prospective employers,
  either making it easier to get a job, or easier to get a better package.

* It *may* also provide an income, although this is a secondary issue.
