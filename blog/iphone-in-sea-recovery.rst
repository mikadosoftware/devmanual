I took my iPhone swimming in the Mediterranean.
===============================================

It was a beautiful setting...

My three year old daughter and I wandered down to one of Kefalonia's
many beautful beaches.  After half an hour of sand castle building and
making friends with other little girls on the beach, I offered the
little girls family a drink from the hut just up the way. After the
usual polite "No let us pay" back and forth I headed to the bar, and
paid with my Apple Pay on the iPhone. And slipped my phone back into
my right hand hip pocket as I have done a thousand times day in and
out in London.

Two minutes later an excited littel girl dragged daddy by the hand to
the cool inviting Mediterranean Sea, and we splashed and bobbed in the
waves.

Arriving back, I passed my daughter her juice carton and bending down
something dug into my right hip.  Oh ... no ... surely not,

The look on the faces of the other's as I pulled my phone out of my
swimming trunks pocket was not nearly as bad as the look on my own.

Turns out seawater is not great for smartphones.  Especially if it
starts to drip out of the earpiece.

The next day was a crash course in the five stages of grief, denial (that did not last long), Anger (Stupid me), Bargaining (please) Depression (yup) and acceptance (googling for the proce of new phones. Wow. They are pricey)

The biggest issue was not loss of the "quick take a look".  I think I
have been fine without my hourly check on Hacker News BBC or podcasts
on Brexit.

What hurts is security access...

I slowly start to put together my digital life


* passwords
* photos
* AWS access
* all the other TOTP accesses...oh god

Github is good - they *give* you the secret and you enter it in
AWS - no I cannot recreate it.
Aargh now what

I decide to start again, with good quality best practises
