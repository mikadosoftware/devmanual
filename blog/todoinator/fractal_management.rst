Fractal Management
==================

Because each individual can and should offer an interfce to their work,
same as team should offer interface to its work.
How we manage at diff levels is the key 

I claim that all management *shoukd* do is 

- model
- monitor 
- mentor

(remember you are responsible for 
culture 
process
people
backlog of work/codebase? 
so need to model and monitor for each of those - i am special casing backlog of work because it's code base manabgemt )

Everything else is "friction".
Some friction is kind of unavoidable - recruitment is an example.  It can be smoothed out but writing job specs, onboaridng etc is spotty at best.
Other friction is yet another meeting to discuss why the current deadline is unachievable, explain why more exploratory work is needed, find out what is going on ... (ie discover what future directions are being discussed by those who control 80% of the budget for next year) (this is why top down planning is a bad idea in gene ram). We laugh at it in communist planned economies and then go donit with our own organisational economies

managing upwards - you too shoukd have someone else doing model, mentor, monitor for you.

Importantly model and monitor are automatabke - see todoinator for modelling developer work.

the rest ... is modelling and monitoring people and team interactions (at bare minimum recording 1:1 and external actions)

external actions are things not viable in code base.


I think this is the point at which a large company becomes a large company - it's some kind of Coasean tipping point - the grey area between it is obvious that the organisation acts like an agent, independnat and the poor it is obvious it should be broken up.

(need to think about this but good idea)


ie given your team, you should see how it is performing, how it interacts with the immediate outside world, and perform those vital people functions

However a lot of non-vital functions are performed - variously describes as meeting hell, shit umbrella etc.

In companies that have a significant proportion of non-vital functions needed, then the bar for doing just enough gets higher, and so the amount of time in meetings, fighting for resources, quality projects etc goes up and the likelihood that a team willing get starved of what it needs increases.

In short superstar managers (politicians) are needed just to perform effectively. 

It seems better to fix the environmental problems than to keep hiring superstar managers

Becoming a manager (generally in large US corporations that's the Director level) takes an enormous commitment of time just to survive (I see it as a form of hazing - if you can do enough to bring in enough resources and projects, 

And Inargue that a lot of this is *automatable*. 

So let's look at HNs most comprehensive review of tasks and see where they fit

""""more cohesive and you have pretty clear objectives, management can be easy. But in larger corps, management becomes this big firestorm of meetings where if you as a manager don't represent your team well enough they will be starved off resources, projects and perhaps more importantly, recognition. Team members will see this and jump ship quickly enough.

This is perhaps the biggest reason I personally prefer smaller companies. Its statistically more likely to have a more effective manager, because a manager doesn't have to be a superstar to get their teams what they need."""

Off the top of my head, these are the kinds of things engineering managers often have to deal with:

Hiring:

- Writing job specs. (modelling)

- Dealing with recruiters (friction)

- Reading CVs/résumés (friction)

- Interviews (friction)

- Onboarding (mentor)

- Outreach (mentor)

- Who do you need to hire next quarter to avoid capacity problems? (model) (also do we need to hire to meet capacity orovkemns or is that architecture?)


People:

- How do you level up your developers? What new responsibilities can you delegate to them so that they can grow without swamping them? Are you available enough to them so you can help them take these new tasks on? (mentor)

- Evaluating training courses / conferences etc. (friction)

- Are there any personal or interpersonal problems that need sorting? (mentor)


- What can you do to help your team gel better and feel like they are part of a team? (mentor)


- Where are your team members' careers heading and how can you help them get there?

(mentor) 


- Your team has grown too large to manage effectively by yourself. How do you split things up? (mentor, model)


Process:

- What is everybody working on? What will everybody work on next?

(monitor, model)


- What are people blocked on? How do you unblock them? What is likely to block them next?

(mentor)


- Can you do things in a better way? How? (self-mentor)

- You've got a lot of bugs in the backlog. Is there a root cause? Are there any patterns? (monitor, model)


- You aren't performing as well as you thought you were. Where is the time being spent? What's the cause? Are the estimates wrong or the performance?(self-monitor)


- Some people want to shift their hours or work remotely. Can you accommodate this? Do you have to adjust process and if so, how?

(mentor)


Line management:

- Approving invoices (you may laugh but friction on this can grow exponentially)

- Approving holidays (friction)

- One on ones (mentor)

- Salary review (mentor)

- Getting people back to work after sickness / parental leave / sabbaticals (mentor)

- Disciplinaries / performance problems (mentor)

- Firing / redundancies (mentor)

- Exit interviews (mentor)

Planning:

- How well is your team performing? How do you measure this and how do you improve? (monitor)

- Do you have enough capacity? (model)

- If not, which features do you bump? (model??)


- Are there any bottlenecks in the pipeline? (monitor)


- What are you telling the shareholders you're delivering next quarter? (model)


Product:

- Does marketing know what you are building next? What information do they need from you to sell it?

(model)


- Do CS know how to support your customers with the new features?

(model)


- Feedback from the rest of the business about the product and how the tech team works.

(monitor)


- Are the specs precise, correct, complete, and achievable?

(model)


- Features have been requested. Are they technically feasible? What's the general size of it and what quarter can we deliver it by?

(backlog management)


- A big customer has a major problem with your product. It's not your fault, but it has a disproportionate affect on the customer. How do you prioritise solving this problem?

( it's of course vital but this is backlog management - everyone has a book of work)


External:

- A shareholder owns a business with a related product that they want integrated ASAP. How do you deal with that pressure without disrupting your plan?

(politics / friction)


- One of your suppliers has a data breach that has leaked your data. How do you deal with that? Have you defined processes for reporting security issues?

(model, friction, process)


- A supplier is failing to perform adequately. Can it be fixed? How do you move away? How soon? Where does the work fit into the schedule?

(process, monitor)


- A supplier has changed their pricing structure. Do you have to move? How soon? Where does the work fit into the schedule?

(process, model (ie we model who our suppliers are)


- a supplier (third party open source library) has stopped updating codebase for a year now. is this a risky 

(monitor) 


- New legislation has been passed and you have to make changes to your product. What are the requirements?

(backlog management / friction )


- A complaint has been made about the accessibility of your product. Does it have merit? What's the impact of fixing it, and how urgent is it?

(backlog management)

- A big prospective customer is on the verge of signing, but they must have one feature that you weren't planning on building until next year. How do you rearrange things to get the customer with minimum impact?

(backlog management)

- A service you use is changing their API. What's the risk of staying on the deprecated version until it can be planned in

backlog management 


this is useful - let's expand it to be todoinator and a complete monitoring service ???
